# A Guide to CMIP6 Participation
##### Karl E. Taylor, Sebastien Denvil, Paul J. Durack, Michael Lautenschlager, Martina Stockhause, Dean Williams and many others

This guide is a “living” document, which will be augmented and updated as needed. It is sub-divided into three parts distinguished by the groups served:

* [Modelers][modelers] carrying out CMIP6 simulations, [Data managers][dataManagers]
 responsible for data node operations, and [Data users][dataUsers] analyzing and making use of CMIP6 model output.

Here are links to the parts of the guide.


### [For CMIP6 participating climate modelers][modelers]:

1. Requirements and expectations
1. Experiment design
1. Forcing data sets
1. Model output fields
1. Model output requirements
1. Software for preparing/checking output
1. Archiving/publishing output
1. Documentation process
1. CMIP6 organization and governance

### [For CMIP6 ESGF data node managers and operators][dataManagers]:

1. ESGF stack installation & upgrade
1. Configuring data/metadata publication on the data node
1. Configuring data publication on the index node (Tiers 1 site only)
1. Configuring ESGF data usage metrics through the esgf-dashboard
1. Configuring CoG (Tiers 1 site only)
1. Validation with ESGF test suite
1. Configuring data access on the data node
1. (Optional) Checking and fixing CMIP time coordinate
1. (Optional) Running PrePARE standalone
1. Preparing directory structure and files organization to fulfill CMIP6
1. Publishing a CMIP6 dataset for the first time
1. Describe datasets issues and errata using the errata service
1. Unpublish data (before new version is ready)
1. Publishing a new version of a CMIP6 dataset

### [For Users of CMIP6 model output][dataUsers]:

1. Experiment design

1. Accessing model output
1. Terms of use and citation requirements
1. Model and experiment documentation
1. Reporting suspected errors
1. Registering published work based on CMIP6
1. CMIP6 organization and governance
