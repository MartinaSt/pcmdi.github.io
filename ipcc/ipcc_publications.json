        "abstract": "The month-to-month variability of tropical temperatures is larger in the troposphere than at Earth's surface. this amplification behavior is similar in a range of observations and climate model simulations, and is consistent with basic theory. On multidecadal time scales, tropospheric amplification of surface warming is a robust feature of model simulations, but it occurs in only one observational data set. Other observations show weak, or even negative, amplification. These results suggest that either different physical mechanisms control amplification processes on monthly and decadal time scales, and models fail to capture such behavior; or (more plausibly) that residual errors in several observational data sets used here affect their representation of long-term trends.",

        "title": "ENSO Simulation in Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Models: Are the Current Models Better?",
        "abstract": "Maintaining a multi-model database over a generation or more of model development provides an important framework for assessing model improvement. Using control integrations, we compare the simulation of the El Ni\u00f1o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and its extratropical impact, in models developed for the 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report with models developed in the late 1990\u2019s (the so-called Coupled Model Intercomparison Project-2 [CMIP2] models). The IPCC models tend to be more realistic in representing the frequency with which ENSO occurs, and they are better at locating enhanced temperature variability over the eastern Pacific Ocean. When compared with reanalyses, the IPCC models have larger pattern correlations of tropical surface air temperature than do the CMIP2 models during the boreal winter peak phase of El Ni\u00f1o. However, for sea-level pressure and precipitation rate anomalies, a clear separation in performance between the two vintages of models is not as apparent. The strongest improvement occurs for the modelling groups whose CMIP2 model tended to have the lowest pattern correlations with observations. This has been checked by subsampling the multi-century IPCC simulations in a manner to be consistent with the single 80-year time segment available from CMIP2. Our results suggest that\nmulti-century integrations may be required to statistically assess model improvement of ENSO. The quality of the El Ni\u00f1o precipitation composite is directly related to the fidelity of the boreal winter precipitation\nclimatology, highlighting the importance of reducing systematic model error. Over North America distinct improvement of El Ni\u00f1o forced boreal winter surface air temperature, sea-level pressure, and precipitation rate anomalies occurs in the IPCC models. This improvement is directly proportional to the skill of the tropical El Ni\u00f1o forced precipitation anomalies.",

        "abstract": "Coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation models (coupled GCMs) with interactive sea ice are the primary tool for investigating possible future global warming and numerous other issues in climate science.  A long-standing problem with such models is that when different components of the physical climate system are linked together, the simulated climate can drift away from observation unless constrained by ad hoc adjustments to interface fluxes.  However, 11 modern coupled GCMs \u2014 including three that do not employ flux adjustments \u2014 behave much better in this respect than the older generation of models.  Surface temperature trends in control run simulations (with external climate forcing such as solar brightness and atmospheric carbon dioxide held constant) are small compared with observed trends, which include 20th century climate change due to both anthropogenic and natural factors.  Sea ice changes in the models are dominated by interannual variations.  Deep ocean temperature and salinity trends are small enough for model control runs to extend over 1000 simulated years or more, but trends in some regions, most notably the Arctic, differ substantially among the models and may be problematic.  Methods used to initialize coupled GCMs can mitigate climate drift but cannot eliminate it.  Lengthy \"control runs\" of models \u2014 made possible by increasing computer power \u2014 are one reason for the improvements this paper documents.",

        "abstract": "The ability of global coupled models to capture the ENSO-monsoon association is examined in the climate of the 20th century (20c3m) integrations submitted to the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). For a proper representation of ENSO-monsoon relationship, we propose that a realistic simulation of the time-mean monsoon precipitation and evolution of sea surface temperature and diabatic heating anomalies in the equatorial Pacific during ENSO are essential.\n \nOf the 18 models examined here, only six are found to have realistic representation of monsoon precipitation climatology in the 20c3m integrations, and in the 2xC02 runs, all of them predict an increase (in the range 5-25%) in monsoon precipitation over the Indian sub-continent, as well as an increase in its variability (5-10%).\n\nFor each of these six models correlation statistics between all-India rainfall (AIR) index and SST over the tropical Indo-Pacific regions for each realization are calculated and then an ensemble mean pattern is computed. Only four models exhibit a robust ENSO-monsoon teleconnection pattern similar to observations, a feature that remains intact and stronger under the climate change scenario. As regards to the timing of the teleconnection, three models represent the observed spring predictability barrier, namely the transition from positive to negative correlations prior to the monsoon onset. Furthermore, only one of these three model captures the observed phase lag with the strongest anticorrelation of SST peaking 2-3 months after the summer monsoon. In the 20c3m and the 2xCO2 runs (1pctto2x) (1) the overall range and time scales of variation of the monsoon-ENSO relationship remain similar, and (2) there is little consistency in the phase among the individual realizations. Item (1) indicates that there is no evidence for a weakening in the ENSO-monsoon connection due to global warming, and item (2) suggests a lack of predictability of the decadal modulation of the monsoon-ENSO relationship. Further examination reveals that models that capture the ENSO-monsoon teleconnection have fidelity in correctly simulating the timing and location of SST and diabatic heating anomalies during El Nino events, lending credence to our hypothesis. The implication of these results on the monsoon prediction are discussed.",

We have separated the 'dynamic' and 'thermodynamic' components of the mean and extreme precipitation changes projected in 6 climate model experiments. The dynamic change is due to the change in atmospheric motion, while the thermodynamic change is due to the change in atmospheric moisture content. The model results consistently show that there are areas with small change or decreases in the thermodynamic change for mean precipitation mainly over subtropics, while the thermodynamic change for extreme precipitation is an overall increase as a result of increased atmospheric moisture. The dynamic changes play a secondary role in the difference between mean and extreme and are limited to lower latitudes. Over many parts of mid- to high latitudes, mean and extreme precipitation increase in comparable magnitude due to a comparable thermodynamic increase. ",

The shift of the storm tracks is accompanied by a poleward shift and upward expansion of the midlatitude baroclinic regions associated with enhanced warming in the tropical upper troposphere and increased tropopause height.  The poleward shift in baroclinicity is augmented in the Southern Hemisphere and partially offset in the Northern Hemisphere by changes in the surface meridional temperature gradient.  The poleward shift of the storm tracks also tends to be accompanied by poleward shifts in surface wind stress and precipitation, and a shift towards the high index state of the annular modes.  These results highlight the integral role that the storm tracks play in the climate system, and the importance of understanding how and why they will change in the future.",

        "title": "Precipitation characteristics in eighteen coupled climate models",
        "abstract": "Monthly and 3-hourly precipitation data from 20th century climate simulations by the newest generation of eighteen coupled climate system models are analyzed and compared with available observations. The characteristics examined include mean spatial patterns, intraseasonal to interannual and ENSO-related variability, convective versus stratiform precipitation ratio, precipitation frequency and intensity for different precipitation categories, and the diurnal cycle. Although most models reproduce the observed broad patterns of precipitation amount and year-to-year variability, models without flux corrections still show an unrealistic double ITCZ pattern over the tropical Pacific, whereas the flux-corrected models, especially MRI-CGCM2.3.2a, produce realistic rainfall patterns at low latitudes. As in previous generations of coupled models, the rainfall double ITCZs are related to westward expansion of the cold tongue of sea surface temperature that is observed only over the equatorial eastern Pacific but extends to the central Pacific in the models. The partitioning of the total variance of precipitation among intraseasonal, seasonal and longer time scales is generally reproduced by the models, except over the western Pacific where the models fail to capture the large intraseasonal variations. Most models produce too much convective (over 95% of total precipitation) and too little stratiform precipitation over most of the low-latitudes, in contrast to 45-65% in the TRMM satellite observations. The biases in the convective versus stratiform precipitation ratio are linked to unrealistically strong coupling of tropical convection to local sea surface temperature (SST), which results in a positive correlation between the standard deviation of Ni\u00f1o 3.4 SST and the local convective-to-total precipitation ratio among the models. The models reproduce the percentage contribution (to total precipitation) and frequency for moderate precipitation (10-20 mm/day), but underestimate the contribution and frequency for heavy (>20 mm/day) precipitation and overestimate them for light (<10 mm/day) precipitation.  The newest generation of coupled models still rains too frequently, mostly within the 1-10 mm/day category. Precipitation intensity over the storm tracks around the eastern coasts of Asia and North America has intensity comparable to that in the ITCZ (10-12 mm/day) in the TRMM data, but it is much weaker in the models. The diurnal analysis suggests that warm-season convection still starts too early in the new models, and occurs too frequently at reduced intensity in some of the models. The results show that considerable improvements in precipitation simulations are still desirable for the latest generation of world's coupled climate models.",

        "abstract": "The Southern Ocean\u2019s Subantarctic Mode Water and Antarctic Intermediate Water are two globally significant upper ocean water masses that circulate in all southern hemisphere subtropical gyres, and cross the equator to enter the North Pacific and North Atlantic Oceans. Simulations of Subantarctic Mode Water and Antarctic Intermediate water for the 20th century in eight climate models that provided their output in support of the Intergovermental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s Fourth Assessment report (IPCC AR4) have been compared to the commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) Atlas of regional Seas. This study is the first step in a thorough analysis of climate model simulation of Southern Ocean water masses, involving both a comparison with observations and amongst the models. Significant model developments over recent years have resulted in a reasonable simulation of Subantarctic Mode Water and Antarctic Intermediate water in many models. Of particular interest is the generally better simulation of Subantarctic Mode Water and Antarctic Intermediate water in the southeast Pacific than in the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean. Combined model and observational studies will help unravel the relative importance of the many suggest processes involved in Subantarctic Mode water and Antarctic Intermediate water formation at and between these two formation regions. A greater understanding of present-day biases in climate model simulations of Subantarctic Mode water and Antarctic Intermediate water will provide important knowledge in the assessment of the impact of these\nwater masses on climate under IPCC future forcing scenarios.",

        "title": "An assessment of the SST influence on surface wind stress in numerical weather prediction and climate models",
        "abstract": "We analyze the ability of six climate models to capture the observed coupling between SST and surface wind stress in the vicinity of strong midlatitude SST fronts. The analysis emphasizes air-sea interactions associated with ocean meanders in the eastward extensions of major western boundary current systems such as the Gulf Stream, Agulhas, and Kuroshio Currents.  Satellite observations of wind stress from the SeaWinds scatterometer on QuikSCAT and sea surface temperatures from AMSR clearly indicate the influence of SST on surface wind stress on scales smaller than about 30\u00ba of longitude by 10\u00ba of latitude. Spatially high pass filtered SST and wind stress variations are linearly related, with higher SST associated with higher wind stress.  The influence of SST on wind stress is also clearly identifiable in the ECMWF operational forecast model, having a grid resolution of 0.35 deg x 0.35 deg (T511). The coupling coefficient between wind stress and SST, as indicated by the slope of the linear least squares fit, is only half as strong as for satellite observations, however.  \n\nThe ability to simulate realistic air-sea interactions is present to varying degrees in the coupled climate models we examine. The MIROC 3-2-HIRES (1.1 deg x 1.1 deg, T106) and the NCAR CCSM3.0 (1.4 deg x 1.4 deg, T85) are the highest resolution models considered and produce the most realistic air-sea coupling associated with midlatitude current systems. Coupling coefficients between SST and wind stress in the MIROC3-2-HIRES and NCAR models are at least comparable to those in the ECMWF operational model. The spatial scales of midlatitude SST variations and SST-induced wind perturbations in the MIROC 3-2-HIRES model are comparable to those of satellite observations. The spatial scales of SST variability in the NCAR model are larger than those in the ECMWF model and satellite observations, and hence the spatial scales of SST-induced perturbations in the wind fields are larger. \n\nWe find that the ability of climate models to simulate air-sea interactions degrades with decreasing grid resolution.  SST anomalies in the GFDL CM2.0 (2.0 deg x 2.5 deg), UKMO HadCM3 (2.5 deg x 3.8 deg), and MIROC 3-2-MEDRES (2.8 deg x 2.8 deg, T42) models have larger spatial scales and are more geographically confined than in the higher resolution models. The GISS Model E-R (4.0 deg x 5.0 deg) is unable to resolve the midlatitude ocean eddies that produce prominent air-sea interaction.  Notably, the MIROC 3-2-MEDRES model exhibits much weaker coupling between wind stress and SST than the higher vertical and horizontal resolution version of the same model. The GFDL CM2.0 and UKMO HadCM3 models exhibit a linear relationship between SST and wind stress. However, coupling coefficients for the UKMO model are significantly weaker than in the GFDL and higher resolution models. In addition to model grid resolution (both vertical and horizontal), deficiencies in the parameterization of boundary layer processes may be responsible for some of these differences in air-sea coupling between models and observations.\n",

        "abstract": "A self-organising map is used to classify the winter circulation affecting southwest Western Australia (SWWA) into 20 different synoptic types. The changes in the frequency of these types and their links to observed rainfall are analysed to further understand the significant, prolonged, rainfall drop observed in this region since 1975. The temporal variability of the different synoptic types link well with the observed rainfall changes. The frequency of the troughs associated with wet conditions across SWWA has declined markedly since 1975 while the frequency of the synoptic types with high pressure over the continent, associated with dry conditions, has increased. Combining the frequency of the synoptic systems with the amount of observed rainfall allows a quantitative analysis of the rainfall decline. The decreased frequency of the troughs associated with very wet conditions accounts for half of the decline. Reductions in the amount of rainfall precipitating from each system also contribute to the decline. Large-scale circulation changes, including increases in the mean sea-level pressure and a decrease in the general baroclinicity of the region have been associated with the rainfall decline. These changes are suggested to be linked to increasing levels of greenhouse gases. Due to the strong link between the number of trough types and the rainfall over SWWA, the shifts in the frequency of these synoptic types could be used as a tool to assess simulated rainfall changes, particularly into the future.\n",

A step-drop in the 1970s to a new winter rainfall regime has caused great concern for water users in the region. The synoptic systems at the height of winter in the latter half of the 20th century over this region have been described in Hope et al. (Clim Dyn, 2006) using a self-organising map, and in this study the projected future shifts in those systems has been examined. Bounds are placed on the possible responses by examining a number of different models and, into the future, two scenarios at the upper (SRES A2) and lower (SRES B1) limits of plausible human induced emissions. Rainfall taken directly from the models captures the rainfall decline in the 1970s, and, although it is not as large as observed in any one model, all the models express a decline, which is a very strong result. Into the future the rainfall decline is dramatic. The scenario at the upper bound of emissions, where atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases continue to rise strongly, shows a rainfall decline right through to the end of the century. The shift in synoptic systems for most models is to far fewer troughs and more high pressure systems across the region. One model exhibits a different signature, with a shift to more systems with a zonal structure. The fact that there is a rainfall decline shown by all models, yet the synoptic changes are different, highlights how sensitive SWWA rainfall is to the different responses of climate models to increasing greenhouse gases. In the B1 scenario, the concentrations rise only slowly in the second half of the century and the shift is still to drier conditions, but it is not as striking. These results show that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases lead to increasingly dry conditions in SWWA, and as the atmospheric concentrations rise, the synoptic response intensifies.\n",

        "abstract": "The capability of reproducing observed surface air temperature (SAT) changes for the twentieth century is assessed using 22 multi-models which contribute to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report. A Bayesian method is utilized for model evaluation by which model uncertainties are considered systematically. We provide a hierarchical analysis for global to sub-continental regions with two settings. First, regions of different size are evaluated separately at global, hemispheric, continental, and sub-continental scales. Second, the global SAT trend patterns are evaluated with gradual refinement of horizontal scales (higher dimensional analysis). Results show that models with natural plus anthropogenic forcing (MME_ALL) generally exhibit better skill than models with anthropogenic only forcing (MME_ANTH) at all spatial scales for different trend periods (entire twentieth century and its first and second halves). This confirms previous studies that suggest the important role of natural forcing. For the second half of the century, we found that MME_ANTH performs well compared to MME_ALL except for a few models with overestimated warming. This indicates not only major contributions of anthropogenic forcing over that period but also the applicability of both MMEs to observationally-constrained future predictions of climate changes. In addition, the skill-weighted averages with the Bayes factors [Bayesian model averaging (BMA)] show a general superiority over other error-based weighted averaging methods, suggesting a potential advantage of BMA for climate change predictions.

        "abstract": "A Bayesian approach is applied to the observed global surface air temperature (SAT) changes using multi-model ensembles (MMEs) of the IPCC AR4 simulations and single-model ensembles (SMEs) with the ECHO-G model. A Bayesian decision method is used as a tool for classifying observations into given scenarios (or hypotheses). The prior probability of the scenarios, which represents a degree of subjective belief in the scenarios, is changed into the posterior probability through the likelihood where observations enter, and the posterior is used as a decision function. In the identical-prior case the Bayes factor (or likelihood ratio) becomes a decision function and provides an observational evidence for each scenario against a predefined reference scenario. Four scenarios are used to explain observed SAT changes as 'CTL' (control or no change), 'Nat' (natural forcing induced change), 'GHG' (greenhouse-gas induced change), and 'All' (natural plus anthropogenic forcing induced change). Observed and simulated global mean SATs are decomposed into temporal components of overall mean, linear trend, and decadal variabilities through Legendre series expansions, coefficients of which are used as detection variables. Parameters (means and covariance matrices) needed to define the four scenarios are estimated from SMEs or MMEs. Taking the 'CTL' scenario as a reference one, application results for global mean SAT changes for the whole 20th century (1900-1999) show  decisive  evidence (logarithm of Bayes factor > 5) for the 'All' scenario only. While 'strong' evidences (log of Bayes factor > 2.5) for both 'Nat' and 'All' scenarios are found in SAT changes for the first half (1900- 1949), there is 'decisive' evidence for the 'All' scenario for SAT changes in the second half (1950-1999), supporting previous results. It is demonstrated that our Bayesian decision results for global mean SATs are largely insensitive to both inter-model uncertainties and prior probabilities.",

        "abstract": "A Bayesian approach is introduced to model evaluation and multi-model averaging with a systematic consideration of model uncertainty and its application to global mean surface air temperature (SAT) changes is shown from multi-AOGCM ensembles of IPCC AR4 simulations. The Bayes factor or likelihood ratio of each model to the reference model (where mean is identical to the observation) provides a skill ranging from 0 to 1. Four categories of model skill are derived on the basis of the previous studies. Legendre series expansions are used to get a temporally refined model evaluation, which allow efficient analyses of time mean (scale) and linear trend. Application results show that all AOGCMs with natural plus anthropogenic forcing can simulate well the scale and trend of observed global mean SAT changes over the 20th century and its first and second halves. However, more than 50% of the models with anthropogenic forcing only cannot reproduce the observed warming reasonably. This indicates the important role of natural forcing although other factors like different climate sensitivity, forcing uncertainty, and a climate drift might be responsible for the discrepancy in anthropogenic-only models. Besides, Bayesian and conventional skill comparisons demonstrate that a skill-weighted average with the Bayes factors (Bayesian model averaging, BMA) overwhelms the arithmetic ensemble mean and three other weighted averages based on conventional statistics, illuminating future applicability of BMA to climate predictions.",

Bayesian decision classifies observations into the most probable scenario out of six available scenarios: CTL (control), N (natural forcing), ANTHRO (anthropogenic forcing), G (greenhouse-gas), S (Sulfate aerosols), and ALL (natural plus anthropogenic forcing). Space-time vectors of detection variable are constructed for six continental regions (North America, South America, Asia, Africa, Australia, and Europe) by combining temporal components of SATs (expressed as Legendre coefficients) from two or three subregions of each continental region.\n\nBayesian decision results show that over most of the regions observed SATs are classified into ALL or ANTHRO scenarios for the whole 20th century and its second half. N and ALL scenarios are decided during the first half of the 20th century, but only in the low latitude region (Africa and South America), which might be related to response patterns to solar forcing. Overall seasonal decisions follow annual results, but there are notable seasonal dependences which differ between regions.

        "title": "Response of the East Asian summer monsoon to doubled atmospheric CO2: Coupled Climate Models simulations and Projections under IPCC AR4",
        "abstract": "      The East Asian (China, Korea and Japan) summer monsoon precipitation and its variability are examined from the outputs of the coupled climate models performing coordinated experiments leading to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report (IPCC AR4). Out of the 22 models examined, 14 reproduce the observed shape of the annual cycle well with peak during the boreal summer (June through August), but with varying magnitude. Three models simulate the maximum a month later and with lower magnitudes. Only one model considerably underestimates the magnitude of the annual cycle. The remaining 4 models show some deviations from the observed. Models are unable to simulate the minimum in July with peaks in June and August associated with northward shifts of the Meiyu-Changma-Baiu precipitation band. The realistic simulation of the annual cycle does not appear to depend on the model resolution. The inter-model variation is slightly larger during summer, implying larger diversity of the models in simulating summer monsoon precipitation.\n\n      The spatial rainfall patterns are reasonably well simulated by most of the models, with several models able to simulate the precipitation associated with the Meiyu-Changma-Baiu frontal zone and that associated with the location of the subtropical high over the north Pacific. Simulated spatial distribution could be sensitive to model resolution as evidenced by two versions of MIROC3.2 model. The multi-model ensemble (MME) pattern reveals an underestimation of seasonal precipitation over the east coast of China, Korea-Japan peninsular and the adjoining oceanic regions. This may be related with the mass-flux based scheme employed for convective parameterization by majority of the models. Further the inter-model variation of precipitation is about 2 times stronger south of 300N, than north of this latitude, indicating larger diversity of the coupled models in simulating low latitude precipitation. The simulated inter-annual variability is estimated by computing the mean summer monsoon seasonal rainfall and the coefficient of variability (CV). In general the mean observed seasonal precipitation of 542 mm and CV of 6.7 % is very well simulated by most of the models. Except for one model mean seasonal precipitation varies from 400 to 650 mm. However the CV varies from 2 to 9 %. \n\n       Future projections under the radiative forcing of doubled CO2 scenario are examined for individual models and by the MME technique. Changes in mean precipitation and variability are tested by the t-test and F-ratio respectively to evaluate their statistical significance. The changes in mean precipitation vary from -0.6 % (CNRM-CM3) to about 14 % (ECHO-G; UKMO-HadCM3). The MME technique reveals an increase varying from 5 to 10 %, with an average of 7.8 % (greater than the observed CV of 6.7 %) over the East Asian region. However the increases are significant over the Korea-Japan peninsula and the adjoining north China region only. The increases may be attributed to the projected intensification of the subtropical high, Meiyu-Changma-Baiu frontal zone and the associated influx of moist air from the Pacific inland. The projected changes in the amount of precipitation are directly proportional to the projected changes in the strength of the subtropical high. Further the MME suggests a possible increase in the length of the summer monsoon precipitation period from late spring through early autumn. The changes in precipitation could be stabilized by controlling the CO2 emissions.\n\n",

        "abstract": "    The South Asian summer monsoon precipitation and its variability are examined from the simulated outputs of the coupled climate models under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report. Out of the 22 models examined, 19 models are able to capture the maximum rainfall during the summer monsoon period (June through September) with varying amplitude. While 2 models are unable to reproduce the annual cycle well, one model is unable to simulate the summer monsoon season. The simulated inter-annual variability for the 19 models is examined with respect the mean precipitation, coefficient of variation, long-term trends and the biennial tendency. The model simulated mean precipitation varies from 500 mm to 900 mm and coefficient of variation from 3 to 13 %. While 7 models exhibit long-term trends, 8 models are able to simulate the biennial nature of the monsoon rainfall. Six models that generate the most realistic 20th century monsoon climate over South Asia are selected to examine future projections under the doubling CO2 scenario. \n       Projections reveal a significant increase in mean monsoon precipitation of 8 % and possible extension of the monsoon period based on the multi-model ensemble technique. Extreme excess and deficient monsoons are projected to intensify. The projected increase in precipitation could be attributed to the projected intensification of the heat low over northwest India, trough of low pressure over the Indo-Gangetic plains and the land-ocean pressure gradient during the establishment phase of the monsoon. The intensification of these pressure systems could be attributed to the decline in winter / spring snowfall. Besides a decrease of winter snowfall over western Eurasia models also project an increase of winter snowfall over Siberia/eastern Eurasia. This projected dipole snow configuration during winter could imply changes in mid-latitude circulation conducive for subsequent summer monsoon precipitation activity. Increase in precipitable water of 12-16 % is projected over major parts of India. However maximum increase of about 20-24 % is projected over the Arabian Peninsula, adjoining regions of Pakistan, northwest India and Nepal. Though the projected summer monsoon circulation appears to weaken, the projected flow over the Bay of Bengal (Arabian Sea) will support oceanic moisture convergence towards the southern parts of India and Sri Lanka (northwest India and adjoining regions). ENSO-Monsoon relationship is projected to weaken. \n",

A previous sensitivity study utilizing the National Center \nfor Atmospheric Research\u2019s (NCAR) atmospheric general circulation model \n[AGCM; Community Climate Model, version 3 (CCM3)] to explore climate \nsensitivity to declining Arctic sea ice cover suggested that, as Arctic sea ice \ncover is reduced, precipitation patterns over western North America will shift \ntoward dryer conditions in southwestern North America and wetter conditions \nin northwestern North America. Here, three complementary lines of research \nvalidate and explore the robustness of this possible climate change impact: 1) \nrepetition of the previous sensitivity study (specified constant Arctic sea ice \ncover and atmospheric CO2) with an updated version of the NCAR AGCM \n[third Community Atmosphere Model (CAM3)], 2) investigation of the climate \nresponse to dynamically reduced Arctic sea ice cover (driven by a quadrupling \nof atmospheric CO2) in the coupled NCAR Community Climate System Model\n(CCSMv3), and 3) analysis of similar results from six other coupled climate \nsystem models. Results from the CAM3 sensitivity study are similar to those \nfrom the original study with declining Arctic sea ice cover driving up to 25% \nless mean annual precipitation (MAP) over southwestern North America and \nup to an 8% increase in MAP over northwestern North America. The seven \ncoupled models also reproduce this same general pattern. At the time of CO2 \nquadrupling, Arctic sea ice cover is reduced (up to 90% in boreal winter) and \nMAP over southwestern North America decreases by up to 30% while MAP in \nnorthwestern North America increases by up to 40%. These results represent a \nsignificant shift in the precipitation pattern over western North America and \nsupport the findings of the original sensitivity study in suggesting that, as future \nreductions in Arctic sea ice cover take place, there will be a substantial impact \non water resources in western North America. \n",

        "title": " Amplified Arctic climate change: What does surface albedo feedback have to do with it?",
        "abstract": "A group of twelve IPCC fourth assessment report (AR4) climate models have Arctic (60N\u201390N) warmings that are, on average, 1.9 times greater than their global warmings at the time of CO2 doubling in 1%/year CO2 increase experiments. Forcings and feedbacks that impact the warming response are estimated for both Arctic and global regions based on standard model diagnostics. Fitting a zero-dimensional energy balance model to each region, an expression is derived that gives the Arctic amplification as a function of these forcings and feedbacks. Contributing to Arctic amplification are the Arctic-global differences in surface albedo feedback (SAF), longwave feedback and the net top-of-atmosphere flux forcing (the sum of the surface flux and the atmospheric heat transport convergence). The doubled CO2 forcing and non-SAF shortwave feedback oppose Arctic amplification. SAF is shown to be a contributing, but not a dominating, factor in the simulated Arctic amplification and its intermodel variation.",

        "abstract": "A technique for estimating surface albedo feedback (SAF) from standard monthly mean climate model diagnostics is applied to the 1%/year CO2 increase transient climate change integrations of twelve IPCC AR4 climate models.  Over the 80 year runs, the models produce a mean SAF at the surface of 0.3 W/m2/K with a standard deviation of 0.09 W/m2/K.  Compared to 2xCO2 equilibrium run estimates from an earlier group of models, both the mean SAF and the standard deviation are reduced.  Three quarters of the model mean SAF comes from the northern hemisphere in roughly equal parts from the land and ocean areas.  The remainder is due to southern hemisphere ocean areas.  The SAF differences between the models are shown to stem mainly from the sensitivity of the surface albedo to surface temperature rather than from the impact of a given surface albedo change on the shortwave budget.",

The model simulations, and this analysis, were conducted in support of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 4th Assessment Report. An application of the methodology to 20th century reanalyses resulted in conclusions congruent with earlier synoptic climatologies that used different techniques. It was found that the SOM methodology is a useful tool for diagnosing differences among a large cohort of often quite divergent simulations, allowing the rapid identification of outliers. \n\nSome models do rather poorly at simulating the present day Antarctic circulation, but taking these outliers into account and considering the models as an ensemble, the simulations of 20th century circulation are reasonable. The most notable outlier was the Centre National de Recherches M\u00e9t\u00e9orologiques model (also known as ARPEGE), which was unable to simulate Southern Ocean cyclones. Also of interest was the excessive cyclogenesis displayed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research CCSM3 model. \n\nThe trend to increasing cyclonicity and stronger zonal winds is quite consistent among models, and is reflected also in an increase in positive Antarctic Oscillation index. The coherence of temperature and precipitation anomaly patterns and their trends reflects the extent to which these are related to circulation.

        "abstract": "We investigate relationships between the mean humidity in the tropical upper troposphere and tropical sea surface temperatures in seventeen coupled ocean-atmosphere global climate models.  This analysis builds on a prior study of humidity and surface temperature measurements that suggested an overall positive climate feedback by water vapor in the tropical upper troposphere, whereby the mean specific humidity increases with warmer sea surface temperature (SST). The model results for present-day simulations show a large range in mean humidity, mean air temperature, and mean SST, but they consistently show increases in upper tropospheric specific humidity with warmer SST.  The model average increase in water vapor at 250 mb with convective mean SST is 44 ppmv per K, with a standard deviation of 14 ppmv per K.  Furthermore, the implied feedback in the models is not as strong as would be the case if relative humidity remained constant in the upper troposphere.  The model mean decrease in relative humidity is -2.3+-1.0 % per K at 250 mb, whereas observations indicate decreases of -4.8+-1.7 % per K near 215 mb.  These two values agree within the respective ranges of uncertainty, indicating that current global climate models are simulating with reasonable accuracy the observed behavior of water vapor\nin the tropical upper troposphere.\n",

        "abstract": "An EOF analysis is used to intercompare the response of ENSO-like variability to CO2 doubling in results from 15 coupled climate models assembled for the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report.  Under pre-industrial conditions, 12 of the 15 models exhibit ENSO amplitudes comparable to or exceeding that observed in the second half of the 20th century.  Under CO2 doubling, three of the models exhibit statistically significant (p<0.1) increases in ENSO amplitude, and five exhibit significant decreases. The overall amplitude changes are not strongly related to  the magnitude or pattern of surface warming. It is, however, found that ENSO amplitude decreases (increases) in models having a narrow (wide) ENSO zonal wind stress response and ENSO amplitude comparable to or greater than observed.   The models exhibit a mean fractional decrease in ENSO period of about 5%.  Although many factors can influence ENSO period, it is suggested that this may be related to a comparable increase in equatorial wave speed through an associated speedup of delayed-oscillator feedback. Changes in leading EOF, characterized in many of the models by a relative increase in the amplitude of SST variations in the central Pacific, are in most cases consistent with effects of anomalous zonal and vertical advection resulting from warming-induced changes in SST.",

Changes in the zonal circulation of the ocean in the region are broadly consistent with the changes in zonal wind stress. In particular, the climate models simulate a strengthening and a poleward shift of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current.  The strengthening of the zonal wind stress also results in intensifying northward Ekman transport across the Antarctic Circumpolar Current which, in the unblocked latitudes of Drake Passage, implies increasing southward geostrophic transport in the ocean below about 2000 m.  Zonal wind stress changes such as these may be expected to enhance the meso-scale eddy activity in the Southern Ocean.",

        "abstract": "In this study, we use existing observational datasets to evaluate 20th century climate simulations of the tropical Pacific. The emphasis of our work is decadal variability of the shallow meridional overturning circulation, which links the tropical and subtropical Pacific Ocean. In observations, this circulation is characterized by equatorward geostrophic volume transport convergence in the interior ocean pycnocline across 9$^{\\\\circ}$N and 9$^{\\\\circ}$S. Historical hydrographic data indicate that there has been a decreasing trend in this convergence over the period 1953-2001 of about 11 Sverdrup (1 Sv=10$^6$ m$^3$ s$^{-1}$), with maximum decade-to-decade variations of 7-11 Sv. The transport time series is highly anti-correlated with sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the central and eastern tropical Pacific, implying that variations in meridional overturning circulation are directly linked to decadal variability and trends in tropical SST. These relationships are explored in 18 model simulations of 20th century climate from 14 state-of-the-art coupled climate models. Significant correlation exists between meridional volume transport convergence and tropical SST in the majority of the models over the last half century. However, the magnitude of transport variability on decadal time scales in the models is underestimated while at the same time modeled SST variations are more sensitive to that transport variability than in the observations. The effects of the meridional overturning circulation on SST trends in most the models is less clear. Most models show no trend in meridional transport convergence and underestimate the trend in eastern tropical Pacific SST. The eddy permitting MIROCH model is the only model that reasonably reproduces the observed trends in transport convergence, tropical Pacific SST, and SST gradient along the equator over the last half century. If the observed trends and those simulated in the MIROCH model are ultimately related to greenhouse gas forcing, these results suggest that the Bjerknes feedback, by affecting pycnocline transport convergences, may enhance warming that arises from anthropogenic forcing in the eastern tropical Pacific.",

Analysis of the thermodynamic structure also shows significant discrepancies between models and reanalyses, the former show warming aloft and increased static stability while the latter show a cooling trend and decreased static stability in the tropical mid-troposphere.

        "abstract": "The observed lack of 20th  Century warming in the central United States (CUS), denoted here as the \u201cwarming hole\u201d, was examined in 55 simulations driven by external historical forcings and in 19 pre-industrial control (unforced) simulations from 18 coupled general circulation models (CGCMs).  20th Century CUS trends were positive for the great majority of simulations, but were negative, as observed, for 7 simulations.  Only a few simulations exhibited the observed rapid rate of warming (cooling) during 1901-1940 (1940-1979).  Those models with multiple runs (identical forcing but different initial conditions) showed considerable intra-model variability with trends varying by up to 1.8\u00b0C/century, suggesting that the historical forcings did not produce consistent trends while internal dynamic variability played a major role at the regional scale.  The wide range of trend outcomes, particularly for those models with multiple runs, and the small number of simulations similar to observations in both the forced and unforced experiments suggest that the warming hole is not a robust response to the estimated external forcings; a more likely explanation is an unusually large realization of internal dynamic variability combined with external forcing.  \nThe observed CUS temperature variations are positively correlated with north Atlantic (NA) sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and both NA SSTs and CUS temperature are negatively correlated with central equatorial Pacific (CEP) SSTs.  Most models simulate rather well the connection between CUS temperature and NA SSTs.  However, the teleconnections between NA and CEP SSTS and between CEP SSTs and CUS temperature are poorly simulated and the models produce substantially less NA SST variability than observed, perhaps hampering their ability to reproduce the warming hole.   \n\n",

        "abstract": "In support of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), simulations of 20th-century climate have been performed recently with some 20 global coupled ocean-atmosphere models.  In view of its central importance for biological and socio-economic systems, model-simulated continental precipitation is evaluated relative to three observational estimates at both global and regional scales.  Many models are found to display systematic biases, deviating markedly from the observed spatial variability and amplitude/phase of the seasonal cycle.  However, the point-wise ensemble mean of all the models usually shows better statistical  agreement with the  observations than does any single model.  Deficiencies of current models that may be responsible for the simulated precipitation biases as well as possible reasons for the improved estimate afforded by the multi-model ensemble mean are discussed.  Implications of these results for water-resource managers also are briefly addressed.  ",

        "abstract": "This study investigates the projections of river discharge for 24 major rivers in the world during the 21st century simulated by 19 coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models based on the Special Report on Emission Scenarios A1B scenario. In order to reduce model bias and uncertainty, a weighted ensemble mean (WEM) is used for multi-model projections. Although it is difficult to reproduce the present river discharge in any single model, the WEM results produce more accurate reproduction for most rivers, except those affected by anthropogenic water usage. At the end of the 21st century, the annual mean precipitation, evaporation, and runoff increase in high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, southern to eastern Asia and central Africa. In contrast, they decrease in the Mediterranean region, southern Africa, and southern North America. Although the geographical distribution of the changes in precipitation and runoff tends to coincide with that in the river discharge, it should be emphasized that the change in runoff at the upstream region affects the river flow in the downstream region. In high-latitude rivers (Amur, Lena, Mackenzie, Ob, Yenisei, and Yukon), the discharge increases, and the peak timing shifts earlier due to an earlier snowmelt caused by global warming. Discharge tends to decrease for the rivers in Europe to the Mediterranean region (Danube, Euphrates, and Rhine), and southern North America (Rio Grande).",

It is revealed that a delay in early summer rain withdrawal over the region extending from Taiwan, Ryukyu Islands to the south of Japan around Japan is contrasted with an earlier withdrawal over southern Chinathe Yangtze Basin, although the latter is not significant due to inconsistent sign of changes among the models. Higher mean sea-level pressure anomalies in the tropical western Pacific in the future may be related to these late withdrawals. Changes in onset dates are relatively less compared to those in withdrawal dates. ",

        "abstract": "The relationships between the natural variability and CO2-induced response over the Pacific region are investigated in terms of the spatial anomaly pattern of SST, sea level pressure and precipitation by a multi-model intercomparison analysis based on the 18-model results contributing to the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report. The analysis indicates that the CO2-induced response pattern is related with the model natural variability modes, ENSO and AO. In the tropical Pacific, an ENSO-like global warming pattern is simulated by the majority of the models with mostly El Ni\u00f1o-like change. In the Arctic region, an AO-like global warming pattern is simulated by many models, with the positive definite AO-phase change if AO-like. It is suggested that the increase in meridional temperature gradient in the upper troposphere and the lower stratosphere provides a preferable condition for the positive AO-like change in the high latitudes by intensifying the subtropical jet, while the increase in the static stability provides a preferable condition for the El Ni\u00f1o-like change in the low latitudes by reducing the large-scale ambient circulations. However, the sign of the mass (SLP) anomaly is incompatible over the North Pacific between the positive AO-like change and the El Ni\u00f1o-like change. As a result, the present models cannot fully determine the relative importance between the mechanisms inducing the positive AO-like change and inducing the ENSO-like change, leading to scatter in global warming patterns in regional scales over the North Pacific.",

        "abstract": "Given the strong natural variability of precipitation, detection of anthropogenic climate change has been mainly based on surface thermal indicators. It is here argued that precipitation variability, whatever its natural or anthropogenic origin, is likely to affect surface temperature and, thereby, to hamper the detection-attribution of climate change at the regional scale. This issue is illustrated over Sudan and Sahel using the outputs of eleven coupled general circulation models having participated in the latest IPCC simulations. Like in situ observations, models show a strong relationship between detrended seasonal anomalies of surface air temperature and precipitation during the summer monsoon season. Linear regressions are then used to remove the precipitation influence on observed and simulated linear trends in surface air temperature. The results indicate that this strategy is efficient to reduce the spread in the simulated surface warming and make it more consistent with the instrumental record over recent decades.",

        "abstract": "In many parts of the world, climate projections for the next century depend on potential changes in the properties of the El Ni\u00f1o - Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The current staus of these projections is assessed by examining a large set of climate model experiments prepared for the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Firstly, the patterns and time series of present-day ENSO-like model variability in the tropical Pacific Ocean are compared with that observed. Next, the strength of the coupled atmosphere-ocean feedback loops responsible for generating the ENSO cycle in the models are evaluated. Finally, we consider the projections of the models with, what we consider to be, the most realistic ENSO variability. \n\nTwo of the models considered do not have interannual variability in the tropical Pacific Ocean. Three models show a very regular ENSO cycle due to a strong local wind feedback in the central Pacific and weak sea surface temperature (SST) damping. Six other models have a higher frequency ENSO cycle than observed due to a weak east Pacific upwelling feedback loop. One model has much stronger upwelling feedback than observed, and another one cannot be described simply by the analysis technique. The remaining six models have a reasonable balance of feedback mechanisms and in four of these the interannual mode also resembles the observed ENSO both spatially and temporally. \n\nOver the period 2051-2100 (under various scenarios) the most realistic six models show either no change in the mean state or a slight shift towards El Ni\u00f1o-like conditions with an amplitude at most a quarter of the present day interannual standard deviation. We see no statistically significant changes in amplitude of ENSO variability in the future, with changes in the standard deviation of a Southern Oscillation Index that are no larger than observed decadal variations. Uncertainties in the skewness of the variability are too large to make any statements about the future relative strength of El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a events. Based on this analysis of the multi-model ensemble, we expect very little influence of global warming on ENSO. \n\n",

        "abstract": "Ensembles of coupled atmosphere\u2013ocean global circulation model simulations are required to make probabilistic predictions of future climate change. \u201cPerturbed physics\u201d ensembles provide a new approach in which modelling uncertainties are sampled systematically by perturbing uncertain parameters. The aim is to provide a basis for probabilistic predictions in which the impact of prior assumptions and observational constraints can be clearly distinguished. Here we report on the first perturbed physics coupled atmosphere\u2013ocean model ensemble in which poorly constrained atmosphere, land and sea-ice component parameters are varied in the third version of the Hadley Centre model (the variation of ocean parameters will be the subject of future study). Flux adjustments are employed, both to reduce regional sea surface temperature (SST) and salinity biases and also to admit the use of combinations of model parameter values which give non-zero values for the global radiation balance. This improves the extent to which the ensemble provides a credible basis for the quantification of uncertainties in climate change, especially at a regional level. However, this particular implementation of flux-adjustments leads to a weakening of the Atlantic overturning circulation, resulting in the development of biases in SST and sea ice in the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans. Nevertheless, model versions are produced which are of similar quality to the unperturbed and un-flux-adjusted version. The ensemble is used to simulate pre-industrial conditions and a simple scenario of a 1% per year compounded increase in CO2. The range of transient climate response (the 20 year averaged global warming at the time of CO2 doubling) is 1.5\u20132.6\u00b0C, similar to that found in multi-model studies. Measures of global and large scale climate change from the coupled models show simple relationships with associated measures computed from atmosphere-mixed-layer-ocean climate change experiments, suggesting that recent advances in computing the probability density function of climate change under equilibrium conditions using the perturbed physics approach may be extended to the transient case. \n",

        "abstract": "Climate model output is used to analyze the behavior of extreme cold-air outbreaks (CAOs) under recent and future climatic conditions.  The study uses daily output from seven GCMs run under late 20th century and projected 21st century radiative conditions (SRES A1B greenhouse gas emission scenario).  We define a CAO as an occurrence of two or more consecutive days during which the local mean daily surface air temperature is at least two standard deviations below the local wintertime mean temperature.  In agreement with observations, the models generally simulate modern CAOs most frequently over western North America and Europe and least commonly over the Arctic.  These favored regions for CAOs are located downstream from preferred locations of atmospheric blocking.  Future projections indicate that CAOs\u2014defined with respect to late 20th century climatic conditions\u2014decline in frequency by 50 to 100% in most of the Northern Hemisphere during the 21st century.  Certain regions, however, show relatively small changes and others actually experience more CAOs in the future, due to atmospheric circulation changes and internal variability that counter the thermodynamic tendency from greenhouse forcing.  These areas generally experience greater near-surface wind flow from the north or of more continental origin during the 21st century and/or are especially prone to atmospheric blocking events.  Simulated reductions in CAOs are smallest in western North America, the North Atlantic, and in southern regions of Europe and Asia.  The Eurasian pattern is driven by a strong tendency for the models to produce SLP increases in the vicinity of the Mediterranean Sea (intermodel mean of 3 hPa), causing greater advection of continental air from northern and central Asia, while the muted change over western North America is due to enhanced ridging along the west coast and the increased frequency of blocking events.  The North Atlantic response is consistent with a slowdown of the thermohaline circulation, which either damps the warming regionally or results in a cooler mean climate in the vicinity of Greenland.",

        "abstract": "The global climate models for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report (IPCC AR4) predict very different changes of rainfall over the Amazon under the SRES A1B scenario for global climate change.  Five of the eleven models predict an increase of annual rainfall, three models predict a decrease of rainfall, and the other three models predict no significant changes in the Amazon rainfall.  We have further examined two models.  The UKMO-HadCM3 model predicts an El Ni\u00f1o-like sea surface temperature (SST) change and warming in the northern tropical Atlantic which appear to enhance atmospheric subsidence and consequently reduce clouds over the Amazon.  The resultant increase of surface solar absorption causes a stronger surface sensible heat flux and thus reduces relative humidity of the surface air.  These changes decrease the rate and length of wet season rainfall and surface latent heat flux.  This decreased wet season rainfall leads to drier soil during the subsequent dry season, which in turn can delay the transition from the dry to wet season.   \n     GISS-ER predicts a weaker SST warming in the western Pacific and the southern tropical Atlantic which increases moisture transport and hence rainfall in the Amazon.  In the southern Amazon and Nordeste where the strongest rainfall increase occurs, the resultant higher soil moisture supports a higher surface latent heat flux during the dry and transition season and leads to an earlier wet season onset.   \n",

        "abstract": "The radiative effects from increased concentrations of well-mixed greenhouse gases (WMGHGs) represent the most significant and best understood anthropogenic forcing of the climate system. The most comprehensive tools for simulating past and future climates influenced by WMGHGs are fully coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs). Because of the importance of WMGHGs as forcing agents, it is essential that AOGCMs compute the radiative forcing by these gases as accurately as possible. We present the results of a Radiative-Transfer Model Intercomparison (RTMIP) between the forcings computed by the radiative parameterizations of AOGCMs and by benchmark line-by-line (LBL) codes. The comparison is focused on forcing by CO2, CH4, N2O, CFC-11, CFC-12, and the increased H2O expected in warmer climates. The models included in the intercomparison include several LBL codes and most of the global models submitted to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 4th Assessment Report (AR4). In general, the LBL models are in excellent agreement with each other. However, in many cases, there are substantial discrepancies among the AOGCMs and between the AOGCMs and LBL codes. In some cases this is because the AOGCMs neglect particular absorbers, in particular the near-infrared effects of CH4 and N2O, while in others it is due to the methods for modeling the radiative processes. The biases in the AOGCM forcings are generally largest at the surface level. We quantify these differences and discuss the implications for interpreting variations in forcing and response across the multi-model ensemble of AOGCM simulations assembled for the IPCC AR4.",

The 1950-1999 period simulations of six IPCC models [GFDL CM2.1, GISS-EH, CCSM3, PCM, HADCM3 and MIROC3.2 (hires)] are analyzed in an effort to bench-mark models in simulation of this leading mode of interannual variability. \n\nThe standard deviation of monthly SST anomalies is maximum in the Nino3 region in all six simulations, indicating progress in modeling of ocean-atmosphere variability. The broad success in\nmodeling ENSO\u2019s SST-footprint \u2013 quite realistic in CCSM3 \u2013 is however tempered by the difficulties in modeling ENSO evolution: Biennial oscillation in CCSM3, and no regular warm-to-cold phase transition in the MIROC model. The spatio-temporal structure, including seasonal phaselocking, is on the whole, well modeled by HADCM3; but there is room for improvement, notably, in modeling the SST foot-print in the western Pacific.\nENSO precipitation anomalies over the tropical Pacific and links to North American winter precipitation are also realistic in the HADCM3 simulation; and, to an extent, in PCM. Hydroclimate teleconnections that lean on stationary component of the flow, such as surface air temperature\nlinks, are however not well modeled by HADCM3 since the midlatitude ridge in the ENSO response is incorrectly placed in the simulation; PCM fares better.\nThe analysis reveals that climate models are improving but still unable to simulate many features of ENSO variability and its circulation and hydroclimate teleconnections to North America. Predicting regional climate variability/change remains an onerous burden on models.",

        "abstract": "The response of the Asian summer monsoon (ASM) to a transient increase in future anthropogenic radiative forcing is investigated by multi-model global warming experiments. Most models show that, in Asia, the summer monsoon rainfall increases significantly with global warming. On the other hand, the future change in the large-scale flow indicates a weakening of the ASM circulation. Enhanced moisture transport over the Asian summer monsoon region, associated with the increased moisture source from the warmer Indian Ocean, leads to a larger moisture flux convergence, which is responsible for the intensification of the mean rainfall. Pronounced warming over the tropics in the middle-to-upper troposphere causes a reduction in the meridional thermal gradient in the Asian region, which is consistent with the weakened monsoon circulation and eastward shift of the Walker circulation.

Response in Sea Level Pressure (SLP) also shows the weakening of both the AL and the Siberian High (SH), which gives rise to a weakened pressure gradient along the eastern coast of the Eurasian continent.

        "abstract": " In many parts of the world, climate projections for the next century depend on potential changes in the properties of the El Ni\u00f1o - Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The current staus of these projections is assessed by examining a large set of climate model experiments prepared for the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Firstly, the patterns and time series of present-day ENSO-like model variability in the tropical Pacific Ocean are compared with that observed. Next, the strength of the coupled atmosphere-ocean feedback loops responsible for generating the ENSO cycle in the models are evaluated. Finally, we consider the projections of the models with, what we consider to be, the most realistic ENSO variability.\n\nTwo of the models considered do not have interannual variability in the tropical Pacific Ocean. Three models show a very regular ENSO cycle due to a strong local wind feedback in the central Pacific and weak sea surface temperature (SST) damping. Six other models have a higher frequency ENSO cycle than observed due to a weak east Pacific upwelling feedback loop. One model has much stronger upwelling feedback than observed, and another one cannot be described simply by the analysis technique. The remaining six models have a reasonable balance of feedback mechanisms and in four of these the interannual mode also resembles the observed ENSO both spatially and temporally.\n\nOver the period 2051-2100 (under various scenarios) the most realistic six models show either no change in the mean state or a slight shift towards El Ni\u00f1o-like conditions with an amplitude at most a quarter of the present day interannual standard deviation. We see no statistically significant changes in amplitude of ENSO variability in the future, with changes in the standard deviation of a Southern Oscillation Index that are no larger than observed decadal variations. Uncertainties in the skewness of the variability are too large to make any statements about the future relative strength of El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a events. Based on this analysis of the multi-model ensemble, we expect very little influence of global warming on ENSO. ",

We adopt the classical approach of computing the Hayashi spectra of the 500hPa geopotential height fields and we introduce an ad hoc integral measure of the variability observed in the Northern Hemisphere on different spectral sub-domains. The total wave variability is taken as a global scalar metrics describing the overall performance of each model, while the total variability pertaining to the eastward propagating baroclinic waves and to the planetary waves are taken as scalar metrics describing the performance of each model in describing the corresponding specific physical process. We obtain that large biases, in most cases larger than 20%, are found in all the considered metrics between the wave climatologies of most IPCC models and the reanalises. The span of the climatologies of the various models is in all cases over 50% of the climatology of the reanalises. In particular, the baroclinic waves are typically overestimated by the climate models, while the planetary waves are usually underestimated. This closely resembles the results of many diagnostic studies performed in the past on global weather forecasting models. The vertical resolution of the atmosphere and, somewhat unexpectedly, of the adopted ocean model seem to be critical in determining the agreement of the climate models with the reanalyses. This study suggests a serious caveat in the ability of most of the presently available climate models in describing the statistical properties of the global scale atmospheric dynamics of the present climate, and, a fortiori, in the perspective of climate change.\n(Email: valerio.lucarini@unicam.it)",

        "title": "Large-scale atmospheric circulation biases and changes in global climate model simulations and their importance for climate change in Central Europe",
        "abstract": "The quality of global sea level pressure patterns has been assessed for simulations by 23 coupled climate models. Many models showed serious large-scale deficiencies in the simulated patterns, especially at mid-latitudes. Five models performed well at all latitudes and for each month of the year. Three models had a reasonable skill.\n\nWe selected the five models with the best pressure patterns for a more detailed assessment of their simulations of the climate in Central Europe. We analysed observations and simulations of monthly mean geostrophic flow indices and of monthly mean temperature and precipitation. We used three geostrophic flow indices: the west component and south component of the geostrophic wind at the surface and the geostrophic vorticity. We found that circulation biases were important, and affected precipitation in particular. Apart from these circulation biases, the models show other biases in temperature and precipitation, which were for some models larger than the circulation induced biases. Despite these deficiencies, the models do simulate many aspects of the observed climate quite well.\n\nFor the 21st century the models simulated quite different changes in circulation, precipitation and temperature. Precipitation changes appear to be primarily caused by circulation changes. Since the models show widely different circulation changes, especially in late summer, precipitation changes vary widely between the models as well. Some models simulate severe drying in late summer, while one model simulates significant precipitation increases in late summer. With respect to the mean temperature the circulation changes were important, but not dominant. However, changes in the distribution of monthly mean temperatures, do show large indirect influences of circulation changes. Especially in late summer, two models simulate very strong warming of warm months, which can be attributed to severe summer drying in the simulations by these models. The models differ also significantly in the simulated warming of cold winter months. Finally, the models simulate rather different changes in North Atlantic sea surface temperature, which is likely to impact on changes in temperature and precipitation. These results imply that several important aspects of climate change in Central Europe are highly uncertain.\n",

To better interpret the origin of that uncertainty, we analyze the sensitivity of the tropical cloud radiative forcing to a change in sea surface temperature that is simulated by 15 coupled models simulating climate change and current interannual variability. We show that it is in regimes of large-scale subsidence that the model results (1) differ the most in climate change and (2) disagree the most with observations in the current climate (most models underestimate the interannual sensitivity of clouds albedo to a change in temperature). This suggests that the simulation of the sensitivity of marine boundary layer clouds to changing environmental conditions constitutes, currently, the main source of uncertainty in tropical cloud feedbacks simulated by general circulation models.",

Seasonal extrema of low-latitude, hemispheric storage generally occur too early in the models, and model-specific errors in amplitude of the low-latitude annual variations are substantial.

        "abstract": "The effect of enhanced greenhouse warming on the behaviour of mid-latitude cyclones is examined for changes in the total number of cyclone events and for changes in the number of intense events using the daily averaged mean sea level pressure simulated by coupled climate models participating in the IPCC AR4 diagnostic exercise. Results are presented for a set of scenarios which were produced using a wide range of increasing levels of greenhouse gases. For the enhanced greenhouse warming experiments, the models simulated a reduction in the total number of events and an increase in the number of intense events. This is a robust result, which essentially all the models exhibit. Comparison of the results for each of the scenarios shows that the magnitude of the changes in the number of simulated events increases with increasing levels greenhouse gas forcing used in the scenarios. Even though the numbers of events change, there is no apparent change seen in the geographical distribution of the events; i.e., there is no obvious change in the positions of the storm tracks seen on hemispheric charts. This was also evident in the results for the filtered variance of the meridional wind which was used as a proxy for cyclone activity. In spite of this, it is possible that small shifts in the storm tracks, which are difficult to resolve with the relatively coarse grid used for analysis, could occur.",

        "abstract": "Anthropogenic changes in tropical rainfall are evaluated in a multi-model ensemble of global warming simulations. Major discrepancies on the spatial distribution of these precipitation changes remain in the latest generation models analyzed here.  Despite this, we find a number of measures, both\nglobal and local, on which reasonable agreement is obtained, notably for the  regions of drying trend (negative precipitation anomalies).  Models agree on the overall amplitude of the precipitation decreases that occur at the margins of the convective zones, with percent error bars of magnitude similar to those for\nthe tropical warming.  Similar agreement is found on a precipitation climate\nsensitivity defined here, and on differential moisture increase inside and outside convection zones, a step in a hypothesized causal path leading to precipitation changes.  A measure of local inter-model agreement on significant trends indicates consistent predictions for particular regions.  Observed rainfall trends in several data sets show a significant summer drying trend in a main region of inter-model agreement: the Caribbean/Central-American region.\n",

        "abstract": "Tropical meridional ocean heat transport is studied in six coupled ocean-atmosphere models in which atmospheric CO2 concentration has been increased. In the Indo-Pacific, the strength of Subtropical Cells (STCs) changes in response to changes in the trade winds. However, the change is not consistent among models. In contrast, in all models the tropical Indo-Pacific heat transport remains nearly constant over time due to compensation of STC and the horizontal gyre variations. Even under strong atmospheric radiative forcing the tropical Indo-Pacific ocean heat transport trends are determined by changes in circulation, rather than changes in the stratification. Ocean heat transport in the tropical Atlantic responds to weakening of the basin-wide meridional overturning circulation (MOC). The trends in the South Atlantic STC do not affect ocean heat transport",

        "abstract": "The ability of five, global coupled climate models to simulate important atmospheric circulation characteristics in the Southern Hemisphere for the period 1960\u20131999 is assessed. The circulation features examined are the Southern Hemisphere annular mode (SAM), the semi-annual oscillation (SAO) and the quasi-stationary zonal wave 3 (ZW3). The models assessed are the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Climate System Model Version 3 (CCSM3), the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation Mark 3, the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Model, the Goddard Institute for Space Studies Model ER (GISS-ER) and the UK Meteorological Office Hadley Center Coupled Model Version 3. The simulations were compared to the NCAR\u2013NCEP reanalyses. The models simulate a SAO which differs spatially from the observed over the Pacific and Indian oceans. The amplitudes are too high over the southern ocean and too low over the midlatitudes. These differences are attributed to a circumpolar trough which is too deep and extends too far north, and to the inability of the models to simulate the middle to high latitude temperature gradient. The SAM is well-represented spatially by most models but there are important differences which may influence the flow over the Pacific and in the region extending from the Ross to Weddell Seas. The observed trend towards positive polarity in the SAM is apparent in the ensemble averages of the GISS-ER and CCSM3 simulations, suggesting that the trend is due to external forcing by changes in the concentration of ozone and greenhouse gases. ZW3 is well-represented by the models but the observed trend towards positive phases of ZW3 is not apparent in the simulations suggesting that the observed trend may be due to natural variability, not external forcing.",

        "abstract": "We examine the representation of the mean state and interannual variability of Antarctic sea ice in six simulations of the twentieth century from coupled models participating in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change fourth assessment report. The simulations exhibit a largely seasonal southern hemisphere ice cover, as observed. There is a considerable scatter in the monthly simulated climatological ice extent among different models, but no consistent bias when compared to observations. The scatter in maximum winter ice extent among different models is correlated to the strength of the climatological zonal winds suggesting that wind forced ice transport is responsible for much of this scatter. Observations show that the leading mode of southern hemisphere ice variability exhibits a dipole structure with anomalies of one sign in the Atlantic sector associated with anomalies of the opposite sign in the Pacific sector. The observed ice anomalies also exhibit eastward propagation with the Antarctic circumpolar current, as part of the documented Antarctic circumpolar wave phenomenon. Many of the models do simulate dipole-like behavior in sea ice anomalies as the leading mode of ice variability, but there is a large discrepancy in the eastward propagation of these anomalies among the different models. Consistent with observations, the simulated Antarctic dipole-like variations in the ice cover are led by sea-level pressure anomalies in the Amundsen/ Bellingshausen Sea. These are associated, to different degrees in different models, with both the southern annular mode and the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). There are indications that the magnitude of the influence of ENSO on the southern hemisphere ice cover is related to the strength of ENSO events simulated by the different models.",

        "abstract": "The IPCC third assessment report states that instrumental records show an increase in precipitation by +0.5--1% per decade in much of the Northern Hemisphere mid- and high latitudes and a decrease of -0.3%/decade over sub-tropical land areas. It has been postulated that these trends are associated with the enhanced levels of atmospheric CO2. In this context, it is natural to ask how continuing rising levels of CO2 may affect the climate in the future. The past IPCC reports have documented numerous studies where increased greenhouse gas concentrations have been prescribed in global climate model simulations. Now, new simulations with state-of-the-art climate models are becoming available for the next IPCC report (the Fourth Assessment Report, AR4), and results from a  number of these simulations are examined in order to determine whether they indicate a change in extreme precipitation on a monthly basis. The analysis involves a simple record-statistics framework, and shows that the upper tails of the probability distribution functions for monthly precipitation are being stretched in the mid- and high latitudes where there already have been reported mean level precipitation increases in the past. In other words, values corresponding to extreme monthly precipitation in the past are according to these result are becoming more frequent.",

Although all low-resolution GCMs produced large differences from observations of streamflow and hydrological components simulated by the streamflow model, the nine-member ensemble performed quite well.

        "title": "Methodology of Regional Climate Impact Studies for West Texas and its Importance",
        "abstract": "The study of impact of climate change on water resources is an important topic of the 21st century.  Rapid changes observed in the global climate over the past 100 years compared to those estimates of climate change over the past 1000 years motivated researchers worldwide to study the forcing factors causing such changes in the climate.  General circulation models (GCMs) are used to analyze the climate change on a global scale.  However, it is an established fact that GCMs are not very efficient in representing regional climate.  Impact studies, such as studying the effect of climate change on agricultural practices; water resources, etc, are carried out on a regional scale because the impact is specific to a given region.  In current project reported herein, the regional climate impact study is carried out for the Brazos River Basin in West Texas.\n\nOwing to the low precipitation rates and high potential evapotranspiration rates of the West Texas region, it is important to understand the effect of climate change on the hydrologic cycle of the region.  The main aim of the research reported herein is to analyze those changes and provide results to the policy makers so they could set up policies for the future in accordance to the changes projected by the models.  \n\nThe first step of the project was to choose a GCM that represents the climate forcings of the West Texas region. GCM grid outputs were used as input boundary conditions for a regional climate model.  The selection of the GCM was based on a careful comparison of the output from 15 GCMs.  The comparison was based on two parameters, climate uncertainty and socio-economic uncertainty.  The climate uncertainty was addressed by comparing the climate change as projected by several models.  The socio-economic uncertainty was addressed by comparing the climate projections by models for different IPCC SRES3 scenarios.  Scenarios A2 and B1 were chosen for this project because they represent the worst and best climate change scenarios, respectively.  In order to select the appropriate GCM for the study area, the output from each model has to be studied to observe how they represent the climate forcings affecting the climate change in the study \narea. \n\nThe purpose of this paper is to present results from comparison of 15 GCM models for use in north-central Texas.  The results will be applied to an ongoing study of the Upper Brazos River Basin water resources to determine the potential impact of climate change on the water resources of that basin.\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n1 Ph.D. Candidate, Civil Engineering Department, Texas Tech University, P.O.

        "abstract": "Global climate models (GCMs) have proven to be a valuable tool for investigating the impact of man-made green house gases on Earth\u2019s climate.  The immediate impact of global warming is increased temperatures.  In early 1990s, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimated a rise in global mean temperatures of 1.5oC to 4.5oC.  The indirect impacts of the climate change include: normal summers but warmer winters; normal daily high temperatures, but warmer nighttime lows; increases in extreme precipitation events (Karl, 1997); and changes in the hydrologic cycle including increased cloudiness.  The rapid progress in computer technologies has allowed for horizontal resolution of the order of several hundred kilometers and advanced treatment of physics in GCMs.  Although global effects are important, the more immediate impacts on humans will be on the regional and local scales.  Therefore it is not practical to predict demands for water, electricity, or agricultural aid based on a global perspective.  The description of the Hydrologic Cycle improves with increasing resolution due to the better topographical representation.  Therefore it is imperative to study regional scale climatic changes.  In this project, the study is concentrated on the Upper Brazos River region in the South Western United States.\n\nIn response to increased fresh water use by humans, water resources planners have developed new approaches for optimizing use of existing water supplies.  For the semi-arid High Plains and Low Rolling Plains areas of Texas, optimal use of water supplies is critical.  The water resources of this region are limited by the combination of low rainfall rates of 20 inches or less per year and potential evapotranspiration rates of up to 100 inches per year.  Water resources planners have a challenging task in allocating scarce water resources.  However, current planning methods rely on historic meteorologic data to determine expected water yields.  The possibility that climate change could dramatically alter current hydrologic systems and invalidate projections of firm yield should be examined.  \n\nThe main objective of the project is to develop a method of transferring climate change as predicted by a Regional Climate Model to assess the Brazos River Basin water resources system.  The study involves developing a Regional Climate Model for 1XCO2 and 2XCO2 scenarios using the Modular Modeling System (MMS) developed by USGS.    The results obtained by a GCM are used as the boundary conditions for the Regional Climate Model.  The CSIRO Mark 2 GCM model was used to generate a GCM for the study area.  The other objective of the project is to compare the dynamic regional model generated by the MMS with the downscaled statistical model already generated for this region by Troy Dorman (2003).  The climate change data obtained by the Regional Climate Model will be used to assess the likely impact of changes on the Hydrologic Cycle in the Brazos River Basin.  The changes in the Evapotranspiration levels and the recharge due to the Climate Change will also be analyzed.\n\nKEYWORDS\n\nRegional climate modeling, GCMs, Brazos river basin water resources, weather prediction, climate modeling, MMS.  \n",

        "title": "Uncertainty in hydrologic impacts of climate change in the Sierra Nevada, California under two emissions scenarios",
        "abstract": "A hydrologic model was driven by the climate projected by 11 GCMs under two emissions scenarios (the higher emission SRESA2 and the lower emission SRESB1) to investigate whether the projected hydrologic changes by 2071-2100 have a high statistical confidence, and to determine the confidence level that the A2 and B1 emissions scenarios produce differing impacts. There are highly significant average temperature increases by 2071-2100 of 3.7\u00b0C under A2 and 2.4\u00b0C under B1; July increases are 5\u00b0C for A2 and 3\u00b0C for B1. Two high confidence hydrologic impacts are increasing Winter streamflow and decreasing late Spring and Summer flow. Less snow at the end of Winter is a confident projection, as is earlier arrival of the annual flow volume, which has important implications on California water management. The two emissions pathways show some differing impacts with high confidence: the degree of warming expected; the amount of decline in summer low flows; the shift to earlier streamflow timing; and the decline in end-of-winter snow pack, with more extreme impacts under higher emissions in all cases. This indicates that future emissions scenarios play a significant role in the degree of impacts to water resources in California.\n\nManuscript (accepted 12 July 2006) available on-line: <a href=\"http://www.engr.scu.edu/~emaurer/papers/maurer_ipcc_manuscript.pdf\">http://www.engr.scu.edu/~emaurer/papers/maurer_ipcc_manuscript.pdf</a>",

Of the three models analyzed, the simulated Arctic clouds of the CCSM3 model have the highest liquid water content, exceeding the observed values. The clouds in the GISS-ER model are characterized by extremely high ice content and little liquid water content, and the HadCM3 model clouds hold moderate amounts of ice and relatively small amounts of liquid water. In the CCSM3 model, the high surface albedo and strong cloud short-wave radiative forcing both significantly decrease the amount of short-wave radiation absorbed by the Arctic Ocean surface during the summer. In the GISS-ER and HadCM3 models, the surface and cloud effects compensate: the first model with higher summer surface albedo has a larger downwelling short-wave flux, compared to the latter model with the lower surface albedo. Due to the differences in the models' cloud and surface properties, the Arctic Ocean surface gains about 20\\% and 40\\% more energy during the melt period in the GISS-ER and HadCM3 models, respectively, compared to the CCSM3 model. The HadCM3 model shows the largest reduction in both the sea ice area and volume during the summer consistent with the largest surface net short-wave radiation. In GISS-ER large winter sea ice thickness impairs the sea ice area reduction during the melt period counteracting the excessive net short-wave flux, while CCSM3 shows a significant decrease in both the sea ice area and volume during the summer despite the net short-wave flux deficiency. Substantial decrease in the sea ice area predicted by the end of the 21st Century in the CCSM3 model is associated with the large drop in the surface albedo, which is only partly compensated by the increased cloud short-wave forcing. In the HadCM3 and GISS-ER models, however, the compensation of the surface albedo and cloud short-wave forcing effects is one of the factors explaining moderate future sea ice volume trends. \n",

        "abstract": "Climate projections are the cornerstone for assessing the potential impacts of change at the regional scale. Such regional assessments are sometimes questioned, however, by the perceived failure of global climate models to reproduce key processes responsible for regional trends. Here, we systematically compare observed climate over the U.S. Northeast (NE) with historical and future simulations from eight global models and two downscaling approaches to answer two key questions. First, to what degree are the global models able to simulate regional circulation patterns and their relationship to surface climate in the NE? How much confidence should we then place in future projections of climate change at the regional level? Some uncertainty remains to be resolved, particularly related to the influence of large-scale teleconnection patterns on surface climate characteristics over a topographically diverse region such as the NE. However, the primary changes projected to occur in climate over the next century \u2013 namely, slightly greater temperature increases in summer as compared with winter, and increases in winter precipitation \u2013 are consistent with projected trends in regional climate processes and are relatively independent of model or scale. Furthermore, downscaling produces accurate representations of temporal and spatial distributions of climate across the region. Together, these suggest confidence in the direction and potential range of the most notable regional climate trends, with the absolute magnitude of change depending on both the sensitivity of the climate system to human forcing as well as the emissions pathway we follow over the next century.",

        "abstract": "Assessing the potential impacts of global climate change on a specific region requires integrating projected changes with the unique regional characteristics that will affect and modify those changes at the regional scale. Focusing on key climate indicators in the U.S. Northeast, we assess the extent to which multiple simulations of 20th century climate from 9 AR4 AOGCMs are able to reproduce observed changes in these indicators, and evaluate projected future trends in primary climate characteristics and indicators of change. The analysis encompasses a range of climate indicators that characterize the region, including heavy rainfall and drought, the depth and extent of snow cover, soil moisture, and streamflow in unmanaged rivers, and changes in biometeorological indicators that depend on accumulated temperature and precipitation, such as growing season, frost days, and Spring Indices. Projected changes in almost all of the temperature-related climate indicators all show signals consistent with warming temperatures across both observations and a broad range of past and future model simulations. In the future, model simulations indicate significantly larger increases under the SRES mid-high (A2) and higher (A1FI) as compared to the lower (B1) emissions scenario. These findings highlight the on-going influence of climate change on a wide range of regional indicators, providing confidence regarding the direction, and guidance regarding the magnitude, of many regional climate trends, many of which appear to depend fundamentally upon the emission pathways followed over the next century.",

Yet, given the present calibrations, a bias is found between different estimates of $\\alpha$, \nwith modelled global albedos being systematically higher than the observed. The difference between models and observations is larger for the more recent CERES measurements than the older ERBE measurements.\nThrough the study of seasonal anomalies and space- and time distribution of correaltions between models and observations, specific regions with large discrepancies can be identified. It is hereby found that models appear to overestimate the albedo during boreal summer and underestimate it during austral summer.\nFurthermore, the seasonal variations of albedo in subtropical areas dominated by low stratiform clouds, as well as in dry desert regions in the subtropics, seem to be poorly simulated by the models.",

        "abstract": "Accurate simulation of ice-sheet surface mass balance requires higher spatial resolution than is afforded by typical AOGCMs, owing in particular to the need to resolve the narrow and steep margins where the majority of precipitation and ablation occurs. We have developed a method for calculating mass-balance changes by combining ice-sheet average timeseries from AOGCM projections for future centuries both with information from high-resolution climate models run for short periods and with a 20-km ice-sheet mass-balance model. Antarctica contributes negatively to sea level on account of increased accumulation, while Greenland contributes positively because ablation increases more rapidly. The uncertainty in the results is about 20% for Antarctica and 35% for Greenland. Changes in ice-sheet topography and dynamics are not included, but we discuss their possible effects. For an annual and area-average warming exceeding 4.5+-0.9 K in Greenland, and 3.1+-0.8 K in the global average, the net surface mass balance of the Greenland ice sheet becomes negative, in which case it is likely that the ice sheet would eventually be eliminated, raising global-average sea level by 7 m.\n",

Projections for the twenty-first century (C21st) indicate no evidence of substantial evolution relative to the end of the twentieth century (C20th), although there is increased divergence of results from downscaling of different GCMs towards the end of C21st.

        "abstract": "We present empirical downscaling of five state-of-the-art AOGCMs to investigate potential changes in wind speeds and energy density in northern Europe. The approach is based on downscaling of the Weibull parameters of the wind speed probability distribution from AOGCM derived 500 hPa and relative vorticity sea-level pressure gradients, and is demonstrated to generate accurate depictions of the wind climate during the transfer function conditioning period. Bootstrapping is used to develop 100 realizations for each downscaling period which are used to assess the uncertainty in the results due to stochastic effects in the AOGCM derived downscaling predictors. Projected changes in the wind speed probability distribution vary with the AOGCMs from which the predictors are derived, but generally it is shown that in the 2081-2100 climate projection period, mean wind speeds, 90th percentile wind speeds and energy density are slightly lower than during 1961-1990 at the majority of the 46 stations studied. Conversely it is found that there is no significant difference between conditions during 2046-2065 and 1961-1990 based on the ensemble of downscaling results. Equally, the winter time of 2046-2065 is largely indistinguishable from 1961-1990 for the majority of stations, while the winters of 2081-2100 appear to be associated with lower mean and 90th percentile wind speeds and energy density.",

        "abstract": "This study evaluates the tropical intraseasonal variability, especially the fidelity of Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) simulations, in 14 coupled general circulation models (GCMs) participating in the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). Eight years of daily precipitation from each model\u2019s 20th century climate simulation are analyzed and compared with daily satellite retrieved precipitation. Space-time spectral analysis is used to obtain the variance and phase speed of dominant convectively coupled equatorial waves, including the MJO, Kelvin, equatorial Rossby (ER), mixed Rossby-gravity (MRG), and eastward inertio-gravity\n(EIG) and westward inertio-gravity (WIG) waves. The variance and propagation of the MJO, defined as the eastward wavenumbers 1-6, 30-70 day mode, are examined in detail.\n\nThe results show that current state-of-the-art GCMs still have significant problems and display a wide range of skill in simulating the tropical intraseasonal variability. The total intraseasonal (2-128 day) variance of precipitation is too weak in most of the models. About half of the models have signals of convectively coupled equatorial waves, with Kelvin and MRG-EIG waves especially prominent. However, the variances are generally too weak for all wave modes except the EIG wave, and the phase speeds are generally too fast, being scaled to excessively deep equivalent depths. An interesting\nresult is that this scaling is consistent within a given model across modes, in that both the symmetric and antisymmetric modes scale similarly to a certain equivalent depth. Excessively deep equivalent depths suggest that these models may not have a large enough reduction in their \u201ceffective static stability\u201d by diabatic heating.\n\nThe MJO variance approaches the observed value in only two of the 14 models, but is less than half of the observed value in the other 12 models. The ratio between the eastward MJO variance and the variance of its westward counterpart is too small in most of the models, which is consistent with the lack of highly coherent eastward propagation of the MJO in many models. Moreover, the MJO variance in 13 of the 14 models does not come from a pronounced spectral peak, but usually comes from part of an overreddened spectrum, which in turn is associated with too strong persistence of equatorial precipitation. The two models that arguably do best at simulating the MJO are the only ones having convective closures/triggers linked in some way to moisture convergence.",

The models show a clear improvement over previous generations in simulating the tropical Pacific climatology. Systematic biases still include too strong mean and seasonal cycle of trade winds. El Ni\u00f1o amplitude is shown to be an inverse function of the mean trade winds in agreement with the observed shift of 1976 and with theoretical studies. El Ni\u00f1o amplitude is further shown to be an inverse function of the relative strength of the seasonal cycle. When most of the energy is within the seasonal cycle, little is left for inter-annual signals and vice versa. An Interannual Coupling Strength (ICS) is defined and its relation with the modelled El Ni\u00f1o frequency is compared to that predicted by theoretical models. An assessment of the modelled El Ni\u00f1o in term of SST mode (S-mode) or thermocline mode (T-mode) shows that most models are locked into a S-mode and that only a few models exhibit a hybrid mode, like in observations. It is concluded that several basic El Ni\u00f1o \u2013 mean state \u2013 seasonal cycle relationships proposed by either theory or analysis of observations seem to be reproduced by CGCMs. This is especially true for the amplitude of El Ni\u00f1o and is less clear for its frequency. Most of these relationships, first established for the pre-industrial control simulations, hold for the double and quadruple CO stabilized scenarios. The models that exhibit the largest El Ni\u00f1o amplitude change in these greenhouse gas increase scenarios are those that exhibit a mode change towards a T-mode (either from S-mode to hybrid or hybrid to T-mode). This follows the observed 1976 climate shift in the tropical Pacific, and supports the \u2013 still debated \u2013 finding of studies that associated this shift to increased greenhouse gases. In many respects, these models are also among those that best simulate the tropical Pacific climatology (ECHAM5/MPI-OM, GFDL-CM2.0, GFDL-CM2.1, MRI-CGM2.3.2, UKMO-HadCM3). Results from this large subset of models suggest the likelihood of increased El Ni\u00f1o amplitude in a warmer climate, though there is considerable spread of El Ni\u00f1o behavior among the models and the changes in the subsurface thermocline properties that may be important for El Ni\u00f1o change could not be assessed.

        "abstract": "Tropical Pacific interannual variability is examined in nine state-of-the-art coupled climate models, and compared with observations and ocean analyses data sets, the primary focus being on the spatial structure and spectral characteristics of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The spatial patterns of interannual sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies from the coupled models are characterized by maximum variations displaced from the coast of South America, and generally extending too far west with respect to observations. Thermocline variability is characterized by dominant modes that are qualitatevely similar in all the models, and consistent with the \"recharge oscillator\" paradigm for ENSO. The meridional scale of the thermocline depth anomalies is generally narrower than observed, a result that can be related to the pattern of zonal wind stress perturbations in the central-western equatorial Pacific. The wind stress response to the eastern equatorial Pacific SST anomalies in the models is narrower and displaced further west than observed. The meridional scale of the wind stress can affect the amount of warm water involved in the recharge/discharge of the equatorial thermocline, while the longitudinal location of the wind stress anomalies can influence the advection of the mean zonal temperature gradient by the anomalous zonal currents, a process that may favor the growth and longer duration of ENSO events when the wind stress perturbations are displaced eastwards. Thus, both discrepancies of the wind stress anomaly patterns in the coupled models with respect to observations (narrow meridional extent, and westward displacement along the equator) may be responsible for the ENSO timescale being shorter in the models than in observations. The examination of the leading advective processes in the SST tendency equation indicates that vertical advection of temperature anomalies tends to favor ENSO growth in all the CGCMs, but at a smaller rate than in observations. In some models it can also promote a phase transition. Longer periods tend to be associated with thermocline and advective feedbacks that are in phase with the SST anomalies, while advective tendencies that lead the SST anomalies by a quarter cycle favor ENSO transitions, thus leading to a shorter period.

        "abstract": "The 20th century simulations by 17 coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation models (CGCMs) submitted to the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report (IPCC AR4) are evaluated for their skills in reproducing the observed modes of Indian Ocean (IO) climate variability. Most models successfully capture the IO&#8217;s delayed, basin-wide warming response\na few months after El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) peaks in the Pacific. ENSO&#8217;s oceanic teleconnection into the IO, by coastal waves through the Indonesian archipelago, is poorly simulated in these models, with significant shifts in the turning latitude of radiating Rossby waves. In observations, ENSO forces, by the atmospheric bridge mechanism, strong ocean Rossby waves\nthat induce anomalies of SST, atmospheric convection and tropical cyclones in a thermocline dome over the southwestern tropical IO. While the southwestern IO thermocline dome is simulated in nearly all the models, this ocean Rossby wave response to ENSO is present only in a few of the models examined, suggesting difficulties in simulating ENSO&#8217;s teleconnection in surface wind. A majority of models display an equatorial zonal mode of the Bjerknes feedback with spatial\nstructures and seasonality similar to the Indian Ocean dipole (IOD) in observations. This success appears due to their skills in simulating the mean state of the equatorial IO. Corroborating the role of the Bjerknes feedback in IOD, the thermocline depth, SST, precipitation and zonal wind are mutually positively correlated in these models, as in observations. The IOD-ENSO correlation during boreal fall ranges from -0.43 to 0.74 in the different models, suggesting that ENSO is one, but not the only, trigger for IOD.\n",

New methods of\ncomparing multiple climate models reveal a clearer and more\nimpact-relevant view of precipitation projections for the current\ncentury.  First, the importance of small spatial scales in multi-model\nprojections is demonstrated.  Local trends can be much larger than or\neven have an opposing sign to the large-scale regional averages used in\nprevious studies.  Small-scale effects of increasing CO2 and natural\ninternal variability both play important roles here.  These small-scale\nfeatures make multi-model comparisons difficult for precipitation.  New\nmethods are presented, which allow information from small spatial scales\nto be usefully compared across an ensemble of multiple models.  Our\nanalysis philosophy works with statistical distributions of small-scale\nvariations within climatological regions.  A major result of this work\nis a set of emergent relationships coupling the small and regional-scale\neffects of CO2 on precipitation trends.  Within each region, a single\nrelationship fits the ensemble of 19 different climate models.  Using\nthese relationships, a surprisingly large part of the inter-model\nvariance in small-scale effects of CO2, is explainable simply by the\ninter-model variance in the regional mean (a form of pattern scaling). \nDifferent regions show distinctly different relationships.  These\nrelationships imply that regional mean results are still useful, as long\nas the inter-regional variation in their relationship with\nimpact-relevant extreme trends is recognized.  These relationships are\nused to present a clear but rich picture of an aspect of model\nuncertainty, characterized by the inter-model spread in seasonal\nprecipitation trends, including information from small spatial scales.\n",

        "title": "Evaluation of a component of the cloud response to climate change in an intercomparison of climate models",
        "abstract": "Most of the uncertainty in the climate sensitivity of contemporary general circulation models (GCMs) is believed to be connected with differences in the simulated radiative feedback from clouds. Traditional methods of evaluating clouds in GCMs compare time\u2013mean geographical cloud fields or aspects of present-day cloud variability, with observational data. In both cases a hypothetical assumption is made that the quantity evaluated is relevant for the mean climate change response. Nine GCMs (atmosphere models coupled to mixed-layer ocean models) from the CFMIP and CMIP model comparison projects are used in this study to demonstrate a common relationship between the mean cloud response to climate change and present-day variability. Although atmosphere\u2013mixed-layer ocean models are used here, the results are found to be equally applicable to transient coupled model simulations. When changes in cloud radiative forcing (CRF) are composited by changes in vertical velocity and saturated lower tropospheric stability, a component of the local mean climate change response can be related to present-day variability in all of the GCMs. This suggests that the relationship is not model specific and might be relevant in the real world. In this case, evaluation within the proposed compositing framework is a direct evaluation of a component of the cloud response to climate change. None of the models studied are found to be clearly superior or deficient when evaluated, but a couple appear to perform well on several relevant metrics. Whilst some broad similarities can be identified between the 60N\u201360S mean change in CRF to increased CO2 and that predicted from present-day variability, the two cannot be quantitatively constrained based on changes in vertical velocity and stability alone. Hence other processes also contribute to the global mean cloud response to climate change.",

        "abstract": "This study focuses on the analysis of winter (ONDJFM) storm events and their changes due to increased anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations over Europe. In order to assess the uncertainties due to model formulation, 4 regional climate models (RCM\u2019s) with 5 high resolution experiments, and 4 global models (GCM\u2019s) are considered.\nFirstly, cyclone systems as synoptic scale processes in winter are investigated, as they are mainly relevant for the occurrence of extreme, damage causing wind speeds. This is achieved by use of an objective cyclone identification and tracking algorithm, applied to the GCM\u2019s. Secondly, changes in extreme near surface wind speeds are analysed. Based on percentile thresholds, the studied extreme wind speed indices allow a consistent analysis over Europe and take systematic deviations of the models into account. Relative changes in both intensity and frequency of extreme winds and their related uncertainties are assessed and related to changing patterns of extreme cyclones. Common feature of all investigated GCM\u2019s is a reduced track density over Central Europe under climate change conditions if all systems are considered. If only extreme (i.e. the 5% strongest) cyclones are taken into account, an increasing cyclone activity for western parts of Central Europe is analysed, although the climate change signal reveals reduced spatial coherency as compared to all systems, partly revealing contrary results. With respect to extreme wind speeds, significant positive changes in intensity and frequency are obtained over at least 20% and 3% of the European domain under study (15\u00b0W-43\u00b0E; 35\u00b0-72\u00b0N), respectively. Location and extension of the affected areas (up to 60% and 50% of the domain for intensity and frequency, respectively), as well as the levels of changes (up to +15% and +200% for intensity and frequency, respectively) are shown to highly depend on the driving GCM, whereas differences between RCM\u2019s when driven by the same GCM are relatively small.

        "abstract": "Understanding the atmospheric low-frequency variability is of crucial importance in fields such as climate studies, climate change detection, and extended-range weather forecast. The Northern Hemisphere climate features the planetary waves as a relevant ingredient of the atmospheric variability. Several observations and theoretical arguments seem to support the idea that winter planetary waves indicator obey a non-gaussian statistics and may present a multimodal probability density function, thus characterizing the low-frequency portion of the climate system. We show that the upper tropospheric jet strength is a critical parameter in determining whether the planetary waves indicator exhibits a uni- or bimodal behavior, and we determine the relevant threshold value of the jet. These results are obtained by considering the data of the NCEP-NCAR and ECMWF reanalyses for the overlapping period. Our results agree with the non-linear orographic theory, which explains the statistical non-normality of the low-frequency variability of the atmosphere and its possible bimodality.",

We adopt the classical approach of computing the Hayashi spectra of the 500 hPa geopotential height fields and we introduce an ad hoc integral measure of the variability observed in the Northern Hemisphere on different spectral subdomains. Discrepancies are found especially in the pre-satellite years of the records in the high frequency-high wavenumber propagating waves. This implies that in the pre-satellite period the two datasets have a different representation of the baroclinic available energy conversion processes. Minor differences are also found in the description of low frequency\u2013low wavenumber standing waves. We observe a positive impact of the satellite data on the representation of wave activity over the oceanic sectors in the period starting from 1979, in particular on the description of high frequency variability. Since in the pre-satellite period the assimilated data are more scarce, predominately over the oceans, and of lower quality than found later on, they provide a weaker constraint to the model dynamics. Therefore, the resulting discrepancies in the reanalysis products may be mainly attributed to differences in the models\u2019 behaviour.",

        "abstract": "In this study we document how model biases in extratropical surface wind and precipitation, due to ocean- atmosphere coupling, are communicated to the equatorial Pacific thermocline through Pacific Subtropical Cell (STC) pathways. We compare the simulation of climate mean Pacific Subtropical Cells (STCs) in the NCAR Community Climate System Model version 3 (CCSM3) to observations and to an uncoupled ocean simulation (the ocean component of the CCSM3 forced by observed wind stress and surface fluxes). We use two versions of the CCSM3 with atmospheric resolution of 2.8 degrees (T42) and 1.4 degrees (T85) to investigate whether the climate mean STCs are sensitive to the resolution of the atmospheric model. \n\nSince STCs provide water that maintains the equatorial thermocline, we first document biases in equatorial temperature and salinity fields. We then investigate to what extent these biases are due to the simulation of extratropical-tropical water mass exchanges in the coupled models. We demonstrate that the coupled models' cold and fresh bias in the equatorial thermocline is due to the subduction of significantly fresher and colder water in the South Pacific. This freshening is due to too much precipitation in the South Pacific Convergence Zone. Lagrangian trajectories of water that flows to the equatorial thermocline are calculated to demonstrate that the anomalously large potential vorticity barriers in the coupled simulations in both the North and South Pacific prevent water in the lower thermocline from reaching the equator. The equatorial thermocline is shown to be primarily maintained by water that subducts in the subtropical South Pacific in both the coupled and uncoupled simulations. It is shown that the zonally integrated transport convergence at the equator in the subsurface branch of the climate mean STCs is well simulated in the uncoupled ocean model. However, coupling reduces the net equatorward pycnocline transport by ~4 Sv at 9S and ~1 Sv at 9N. An increase in the atmospheric resolution from T42 to T85 results in more realistic equatorial trades and off-equatorial convergence zones.",

        "title": "Pacific Subtropical Cell variability in coupled climate model simulations of the late 19th-20th Century",
        "abstract": "Observational studies of the Pacific basin since the 1950's have demonstrated that a decrease (increase) in tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures (SSTs) is significantly correlated with a spin-up (slow-down) of the Pacific Subtropical Cells (STCs). STCs are shallow wind-driven overturning circulations that provide a pathway by which extratropical atmospheric variability can impact the equatorial Pacific thermocline and, through upwelling in the eastern equatorial Pacific, tropical Pacific SSTs. Recent studies have shown that this observed relationship between SSTs and STCs is absent in coupled climate model simulations of the late 19th-20th centuries. In this paper we investigate what causes this relationship to breakdown and to what extent this limits the models' ability to simulate observed climate change in the equatorial Pacific since the late 19th century. To provide insight into these questions we first show that the NCAR Community Climate System Model's simulation of observed climate change since the 1970's has a robust signal in the equatorial Pacific that bears a close resemblance to observations. Strikingly absent is a robust signal in the equatorial thermocline due to the underestimate of STC variability. Our results suggest that the coupled model may be reproducing the observed local ocean response to changes in forcing but inadequately reproducing the remote STC-forcing of the tropical Pacific due to the underestimate of extratropical winds that force these ocean circulations. These conclusions are found to be valid in 5 different coupled climate model simulations of the late 19th-20th centuries (CCSM3, GISS EH, GFDL-CM2.1, CSIRO-Mk3, and HadCM3).",

The error in precipitation simulation corresponds to that in circulation simulation.\n  Moreover, we also evaluate the simulation performance of precipitation in interannual variability and during the period of the monsoon onset and retreat. It is found that the models have better simulation performances in winter West Pacific Ocean than that in summer. The simulations are not very well in Eastern Asia Subtropical and Indian Ocean.

        "title": "Dynamical greenhouse-plus feedback and polar warming amplification. Part I: A dry radiative-transportive climate model",
        "abstract": "In this paper, we use a dry radiative-transportive climate model to illustrate that the atmospheric poleward heat transport plays an important role in amplifying the polar surface warming due to anthropogenic greenhouse gases.  Because of a much warmer surface in tropics, the anthropogenic radiative forcing is larger in tropics than in extratropics for same amount of anthropogenic greenhouse gases.   A direct response to the anthropogenic radiative forcing is an increase in the atmosphere equator-to-pole temperature contrast, leading to a strengthening of the atmospheric poleward heat transport.   As a result, part of the extra amount of energy intercepted by the low-latitude atmosphere due to an increase in its opacity is transported to high latitudes.  This implies a \u201cgreenhouse-plus\u201d (\u201cgreenhouse-minus\u201d) feedback to the high (low) latitude surface temperatures, which acts to amplify (reduce) the initial surface warming in high (low) latitudes, causing a larger warming in high latitudes.  The Stefan-Boltzmann feedback suppresses the negative dynamical feedback in low latitudes more strongly than the positive in high latitudes, amplifying the global mean surface temperature warming.   \nBecause of the oceanic poleward heat transport, the ocean surface temperature in extratropics is warmer in winter compared to the land, implying a larger radiative forcing for the same amount of anthropogenic greenhouse gases.  The same dynamical feedback mechanism would also amplify the land surface warming in extratropics by transporting part of the extra amount of energy intercepted by the atmosphere over the ocean surface to land.   This explains partly why the observed land surface warming in extratropics is stronger than the surrounding oceans in winter. \n",

        "title": "FOOTPRINT OF THE DYNAMICAL AMPLIFIER OF GLOBAL WARMING AND ATTRIBUTION OF MODELS\u2019 UNCERTAINTIES",
        "abstract": "The largest warming over the last several decades has been observed in high latitudes. Cai (2005) proposed that part of the large amplitude climate warming in high latitudes could be explained by the \u201cdynamical amplifier\u201d feedback. This study will first provide observational and modeling evidences to validate the dynamical amplifier theory. The second part will address the question whether part of the differences in the CGCM\u2019s global warming projections can be explained by the dynamical amplifier theory. The theory predicts an upward trend of the net radiation surplus (deficit) in low (high) latitudes forced by anthropogenic greenhouse gazes. \n\tThe radiation budget at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) using the ERA40 reanalysis and climate model simulations forced by anthropogenic radiative forcings made at 14 climate centers were analyzed.  The results indicate that both the radiation energy surplus in low latitudes and deficit in high latitudes at the TOA have been strengthened over the last several decades. Such an intensification of the radiation energy imbalance at the TOA is also confirmed by most of the climate model simulations.  Furthermore, the analysis of the net radiation budget between the surface and the TOA confirms that the change in the TOA energy imbalance is indeed due to the upward trend in the poleward heat transport, in accordance with the dynamical amplifier theory. \n\tThere is a large model-to-model variability of the intensification of the poleward heat transport among the 14 climate model simulations. It is found that about 59% of the global warming projection uncertainties, which varies from 1.5K to 4K, forced by the 2CO2 forcing can be explained by the variation of the intensification of the poleward heat transport among models.  The inter-model variability of the change in the poleward heat transport explains about 66% of the warming projection uncertainties for the Northern Hemisphere (NH) and 54% for the Southern Hemisphere (SH).  The differences in the poleward heat transport intensification also explain about 71% and 49% of the warming uncertainties in the NH and SH high latitudes.  Therefore, it can be concluded that a large part of the uncertainties in the CGCM\u2019s global warming projections can be explained by the dynamical amplifier theory.\n",

        "abstract": "This paper discusses issues that surround the development of empirical downscaling techniques as context for presenting a new approach based on Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs). The technique is applied to the downscaling of daily precipitation over South Africa. SOMs are used to characterize the state of the atmosphere on a localized domain surrounding each target location, based on NCEP 6-hourly reanalysis data from 1979-2002, and using surface and 700 hPa u and v wind vectors and specific and relative humidities, and surface temperature. Each unique atmospheric state is associated with an observed precipitation probability distribution function (PDF). Future climate states are derived from three GCMs: HadAM3, ECHAM4.5, CSIRO Mk2. In each case, the GCM data are mapped to the NCEP SOMs for each target location and a precipitation value is drawn at random from the associated precipitation PDF. The downscaling approach combines the advantages of a direct transfer function and a stochastic weather generator, and provides an indication of the strength of the regional versus stochastic forcing, as well as a measure of stationarity in the atmosphere-precipitation relationship.\n\nThe methodology is applied to South Africa. The downscaling reveals a similarity in the projected climate change between the models. Each GCM is projecting similar changes in atmospheric state and they converge on a downscaled solution that points to increased summer rainfall in the interior and eastern part of the country, and a decrease in winter rainfall in the Western Cape. The actual GCM precipitation projections from the three models show large areas of inter-model disagreement, suggesting that the model differences may be due to their precipitation parameterization schemes, rather than to basic disagreements in their projections of the changing atmospheric state over South Africa.",

        "abstract": "This paper examines variations of the surface air temperature (SAT) over China and the globe in the twentieth-century simulated by nineteen coupled climate models driven by historical natural and anthropogenic forcings. Most models perform well in simulating both the global and the Northern Hemispheric mean SAT evolutions of the twentieth-century. The inclusion of natural forcings improves the simulation, in particular for the first half of the century. The reproducibility of the SAT averaged over China is lower than that of the global and hemispheric averages, but it is still acceptable. The contribution of natural forcings to the SAT over China in the first half of the century is not as robust as that to the global and hemispheric averages. No model could successfully produce the reconstructed warming over China in the 1920s. The prescribed natural and anthropogenic forcings in the coupled climate models mainly produce the warming trends and the decadal to interdecadal scale SAT variations with poor performances at shorter timescales. The prominent warming trend in the last half of the century over China and its acceleration in recent decades are weakly simulated. There are discrepancies between the simulated and observed regional features of the SAT trend over China. Few models could produce the summertime cooling over the middle part of eastern China (27\u00ba-36\u00baN), while two models acceptably produce the meridional gradients of the wintertime warming trends, with North China experiencing larger warming. Limitations of the current state-of-the-art coupled climate models in simulating spatial patterns of the twentieth-century SAT over China cast a shadow upon their capability toward projecting credible geographical distributions of future climate change through IPCC scenario simulations.\n \n",

        "title": "On the tropical origin of uncertainties in the global land precipitation response to global warming",
        "abstract": "Understanding the response of the global hydrological cycle to recent and future anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols is a major challenge for the climate modelling community. Recent climate scenarios produced for the fourth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) are here analysed to explore the geographical origin of, and the possible reasons for, uncertainties in the hydrological model response to global warming. Using the 20th century simulations and the SRES-A2 scenarios from eight different coupled ocean-atmosphere models, it is shown that the main uncertainties originate from the tropics, where even the sign of the zonal mean precipitation change remains uncertain over land. Given the large interannual fluctuations of tropical precipitation, it is then suggested that the ENSO variability can be used as a surrogate of climate change to better constrain the model reponse. While the simulated sensitivity of global land precipitation to global mean surface temperature indeed shows a remarkable similarity between the interannual and climate change timescales respectively, the model ability to capture the ENSO-precipitation relationship is not a major constraint on the global hydrological projections. Only the model that exhibits the highest precipitation sensitivity clearly appears as an outlier. Besides deficiencies in the simulation of the ENSO-tropical rainfall teleconnections, the study indicates that uncertainties in the 21st century evolution of these teleconnections represent an important contribution to the model spread, thus emphasizing the need for improving the simulation of the tropical Pacific variability to provide more reliable scenarios of the global hydrological cycle. It also suggests that validating the mean present-day climate is not sufficient to assess the reliability of climate projections, and that interannual variability is another suitable and possibly more useful candidate for constraining the model response. Finally, it is shown that uncertainties in precipitation change are, like precipitation itself, very unevenly distributed over the globe, the most vulnerable countries sometimes being those where the anticipated precipitation changes are the most uncertain.\n",

        "abstract": "In this paper, the ability of model outputs from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to describe the natural internal variability of precipitation observations is evaluated. The analysis is focused on the Iberian peninsula for December-January-February (DJF). The study was performed with observed data from National Meteorological Institutes, reanalysis data from National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research, teleconnection indices and model simulations. First, we evaluated the seasonal cycle, mean winter pattern and tendency for nine model simulations. Then, we selected four models to obtain interannual variability and to diagnose the links between precipitation and large-scale circulation. This inter-comparison is based on the modes obtained by the Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) and spectral analyses to investigate the temporal properties of the most significant spatial patterns. The models reproduce well the observed seasonal cycle and the mean winter pattern; however, they poorly capture the interannual variability found in observed data. To ascertain the reasons for these results, features affecting the precipitation process are considered by analyzing the relationships with the dominant modes of large-scale atmospheric fields, such as sea level pressure, storm activity, jet stream, moisture flux, and teleconnection indices. The precipitation response to the mean flow suggests signs of potential seasonal predictability in DJF.",

        "abstract": "Projections for South America of future climate change conditions in mean state and seasonal cycle for temperature during the 21st century are discussed. Our analysis includes one simulation of seven Atmosphere-Ocean Global Circulation Models (AOGCMs), which participated in the IPCC Project and provided at least one simulation for the 20th century (20c3m) and one simulation for each of three SRES scenarios A2, A1B and B1. We developed a statistical method based on neural networks and Bayesian statistics to evaluate the models\u2019 skills in simulating late 20th century temperature over continental areas. Some criteria (Model Weight Indices) are computed allowing comparing over such large regions how each model captures the temperature large scale structures and contributes to the multi-model combination. As the study demonstrates, the use of neural networks, optimized by Bayesian statistics, leads to two major results. First, the Model Weights Indices can be interpreted as optimal weights for a linear combination of the climate models. Second, the comparison between the neural network projection of 21st century conditions and a linear combination of such conditions allows the identification of the regions, which will most probably change, according to model biases and model ensemble variance. Model simulations in the southern tip of South America and along the Chilean and Peruvian coasts or in the northern coasts of South America (Venezuela, Guiana) are particularly poor. Overall, our results present an upper bound of potential temperature warming for each scenario. Spatially, in SRES A2, our major findings are that Tropical South America could warm up by about 4\u00b0C, while southern South America would also undergo  a near 2-3\u00b0C  average warming. Interestingly, this annual mean temperature trend is modulated by the seasonal cycle in a contrasted way according to the regions. In southern South America, the amplitude of the seasonal cycle tends to increase, while in northern South America, the amplitude of the seasonal cycle would be reduced leading to much milder winters. We show that all the scenarios have similar patterns and only differ in amplitude. SRES A1B differ from SRES A2 mainly for  the late 21st century, reaching more or less an 80%-90% amplitude compared  to SRES A2. SRES B1, however, diverges from the other scenarios as soon as 2025. For the late 21st century, SRES B1 displays amplitudes, which are about half those of SRES A2.",

We developed a statistical method based on neural networks and Bayesian statistics to compute a transfer function between models and observations. Such a transfer function was then used to project future conditions and to derive what we would call the optimal model combination for 21st century climate change projections. To evaluate the results, various criteria were computed making it possible to evaluate the models\u2019 skills in simulating late 20th century precipitation over continental areas as well as their divergence in projecting climate change conditions. Despite the relatively poor skill of most of the climate models in simulating present-day large scale precipitation patterns, we identified two types of models: the climate models with moderate-to-normal (i.e. close to observations) precipitation amplitudes over the Amazonian basin; and the climate models with a low precipitation in that region and too high a precipitation on the equatorial Pacific coast. Under SRES A2 greenhouse gas forcing, the neural network simulates an increase in precipitation over the La Plata basin coherent the mean model ensemble projection. Over the Amazonian basin, a decrease in precipitation is projected. However, the models strongly diverge, and the neural network was found to give more weight to models, which better simulate present-day climate conditions. In the southern tip of the continent, the models poorly simulate present-day climate. However, they display a fairly good convergence when simulating climate change response with a weak increase south of 45\u00b0S and a decrease in Chile between 30\u00b0S and 45\u00b0S. Other scenarios (A1B and B1) strongly resemble the SRES A2 trends but with weaker amplitudes. ",

Here we utilize sea ice extent trends determined from satellite data for both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres for the period 1972(73)-2004, and assess and interpret them using results from simulations by eleven climate models.  In the Northern Hemisphere (NH), observations show a statistically significant decrease of sea ice extent and an acceleration of sea ice retreat during the past three decades. However, from the modeled natural variability of sea ice extents in control simulations, we conclude that the acceleration is not statistically significant and should not be extrapolated into the future.  Most of the models, like the observations, show an absence of a prominent seasonal cycle in the trend values.  Both observations and model simulations show that climate variability in sea ice extent in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) is much larger than in the NH and that the SH sea ice extent trends are not statistically significant.

Significant between-model variability is found, with most models underestimating mean NA-SCE. 20th century simulations are poorly\ncorrelated with observations, and, while individual ensemble members capture the magnitude of decadal scale variability, the variability of the signal is dampened in the ensemble mean, indicating that decadal-scale NA-SCE\nvariability is associated predominantly with internal model variability rather than external forcing. Two 21st century emission scenarios with realistic (moderate or significant) greenhouse gas emission rates produce decreasing NA-SCE trends, while one unrealistic scenario with fixed concentrations produces little or no NA-SCE trend.

This work is focused on trends of precipitation and clouds over tropical ocean and land.\nWe find that the CGCMs are reasonably consistent in depicting aspects of long term changes in the twentieth century climate and the tropical hydrological cycle, including 1) a relatively good simulation of trends in surface warming over both the tropical ocean and land, in agreement with observations; 2) increasing precipitation over the tropical ocean and decreasing precipitation over tropical land; 3) an increasing trend in heavy and light rain, but a decreasing trend in moderate rain, over the tropical ocean; and 4) a reduction in total cloud cover in the tropics. These successful simulations are encouraging and enhance our confidence in the future climate projections provided by these models. On the other hand, the current generation of CGCMs still has a number of deficiencies, particularly in modeling clouds and their interactions with radiation. Although most CGCMs are able to simulate the correct sign of trends in precipitation and clouds, they significantly underestimate the magnitudes of the observations. These underestimations likely cause gross errors in model simulations of the global water and energy balance. A better understanding of physical processes and an improvement in the CGCM representations of physical processes associated with clouds and their interaction with radiation are needed. ",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we evaluate the performance of 19 coupled general circulation model (CGCM) in 20th Century simulations of the Sahel during 1970 to 1990\u2019s.  Correlation, regression, and cluster analyses are applied to observations and model outputs including Sahel monthly precipitation, evaporation, soil moisture, and sea surface temperature (SST).  We find that only eight CGCMs (hit-models) produce a reasonable Sahel drought signal, and seven CGCMs (miss-models) produce excessive rainfall over Sahel during the observed drought period.  Even the model with the highest prediction skill of the Sahel drought could only predict the increasing trend of severe drought events but not the beginning and duration of the events.     From analyses of the statistical characteristics of the hit- and miss- models,  we conclude that a good simulation of the Sahel drought requires a) a strong coupling between Sahel rainfall and Indian Ocean SST, with warm (cold) SST identified with Sahel drought (flood),  b) a significant coupling  between Sahel rainfall and  the Atlantic Ocean SST, with a warm equatorial Atlantic and cold extratropical North Atlantic coexisting with Sahel drought, and vice versa, and c) a robust land-surface feedback with strong sensitivity of precipitation and land evaporation to soil moisture.   These three characteristics constitute a sufficient condition for a good simulation of Sahel drought in CGCMs.  ",

        "abstract": "Results from eight ocean-atmosphere general circulation models are used to evaluate the influence of the projected changes in the oceanic stratification on the first baroclinic Rossby radius of deformation in the ocean,associated with atmospheric CO2 increase. For each of the models, an oceanic state corresponding to the A1B stabilization experiment (with atmospheric CO2 concentration of 720 ppm) is compared to a state corresponding to the pre-industrial control experiment (with atmospheric CO2 concentration of\n280 ppm). In all of the models, the first baroclinic Rossby radius increases with increasing oceanic stratification in the warmer climate. There is, however, a considerable range among the models in the magnitude of the increase. At the latitudes of intense eddy activity associated with instability of western boundary currents (around 35-40 deg), the increase reaches 4 km on average, or about 15% of the local baroclinic Rossby radius. Some of the models predict an increase of the baroclinic Rossby radius by \nmore than 20% at these latitudes under the applied forcing. It is therefore suggested that in a plausible future warmer climate, the characteristic length scale of mesoscale eddies, as well as boundary currents and fronts, may increase. In addition, since the speed of long baroclinic Rossby waves is proportional to the squared baroclinic Rossby radius of deformation, the results suggest that the time scale for large-scale dynamical oceanic adjustment may decrease in the warmer climate, thereby increasing the frequency of long-term climate variability where the oceanic Rossby wave dynamics set the dominant period. Finally, the speed of equatorial Kelvin waves and Rossby waves, carrying signals along the Equator, including those related to ENSO, is projected to increase. ",

        "abstract": "We have synthesized the sea ice simulations by the IPCC AR4 (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the 4th Assessment Report) models for the climate of the 20th century and for global warming scenarios. A large number of model simulations realistically captured the climatological annual mean, seasonal cycle and temporal trends of sea ice area over the Northern Hemisphere during 1979-99, although there is considerable scatter among the models. In particular, multi-model ensemble means show promising estimates very close to observations for the late 20th century. Model projections for the 21st century demonstrate the largest sea ice area decreases generally in the SRES (Special Report on Emission Scenarios) A1B and A2 scenarios compared with the B1 scenario, indicating large multi-model ensemble mean reductions of -3.54 1.66X105 km2/decade in A1B, -4.08 1.33X105km2/decade in A2, and -2.22 1.11X105km2/decade in B1. The corresponding percentage reductions are 31.1%, 33.4%, and 21.6% in the last 20 years of the 21st century, relative to 1979-99. Further, multiyear ice coverage decreases rapidly at rates of -3.86 2.07X105km2/decade in A1B, -4.94 1.91X105km2/decade in A2 and -2.67 1.7107X105km2/decade in B1, making major contributions to the total ice reductions. In contrast, seasonal (first-year) ice area increases by 1.10 2.46X105km2/decade, 1.99 1.47X105 km2/decade and 1.05 1.9247 X105 km2/decade in the same scenarios, leading to decreases of 59.7% and 65.0% of the multiyear ice area and increases of 14.1% and 27.8% of the seasonal ice area in the last 20 years of this century.  Statistical analysis shows that many of the models are consistent in the sea ice change projections among all scenarios. The results include an evaluation of the 99% confidence interval of the model-derived change of sea ice coverage, giving a quantification of uncertainties in estimating sea ice changes based on the participating models. Hence the seasonal cycle of sea ice area is amplified and an increased large portion of seasonally ice-covered Arctic Ocean is expected at the end of the 21st century. The very different changes of multiyear and seasonal ice may have significant implications for the polar energy and hydrological budgets and pathways.",

        "abstract": "We compare the climate feedbacks in coupled ocean-atmosphere models using a coordinated set of 21st century climate change experiments. Water vapor is found to provide the largest positive feedback in all models and its strength is consistent with that expected from constant relative humidity changes in water vapor mixing ratio. The feedbacks from clouds and surface albedo are also found to be positive in all models, while the only stabilizing (negative) feedback comes from the temperature response. Large intermodel differences in the lapse-rate feedback are observed and shown to be associated with differing regional patterns of surface warming. Consistent with previous studies, we find the vertical changes in temperature and water vapor to be tightly coupled in all models and, importantly, demonstrate that intermodel differences in the sum of lapse-rate and water vapor feedbacks are small. In contrast, intermodel differences in cloud feedback are found to provide the largest source of uncertainty in current predictions of climate sensitivity.",

        "abstract": "Using the climate change experiments generated for the Fourth Assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, we examine some aspects of the changes in the hydrological cycle that are robust across the models.  These responses include the decrease in convective mass fluxes, the increase in horizontal moisture transport, the associated enhancement of the pattern of evaporation minus precipitation and its temporal variance, and the decrease in the horizontal sensible heat transport in the extratropics.  A surprising finding is that a robust decrease in extratropical sensible heat transport is found only in the equilibrium climate response, as estimated in slab-ocean responses to the doubling of CO2, and not in transient climate change scenarios.  All of these robust responses are consequences of the increase in lower tropospheric water vapor.",

The cloud feedbacks in any given model are generally not consistent: the sign of the net cloud radiative feedback may vary according to the experimental design. However, both sets of experiments indicate that the variation of the total climate feedback across the models depends primarily on the variation of the net cloud feedback. Changes in different cloud types show much greater consistency between the two experiments for any individual model and amongst the set of models analyzed here. This suggests that the SST perturbation experiments may provide useful information on the processes associated with cloud changes which is not evident when analysis is restricted to feedbacks defined in terms of the change in cloud radiative forcing.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an update on the detection and attribution of global annual mean surface air temperature changes, using recently developed climate models. In particular, it applies a new methodology that permits the inclusion of many more general circulation models (GCMs) into the analysis, and it also includes more recent observations. This methodology involves fitting a series of energy balance models (EBMs) to the GCM output in order to estimate the temporal response patterns to the various forcings.\n\nDespite considerable spread in estimated EBM parameters, characteristics of model performance, such as the transient climate response, appear to be more constrained for each of the forcings. The resulting estimated response patterns are provided as input to the standard fingerprinting method used in previous studies. The estimated GCM responses to changes in greenhouse gases are detected in the observed record for all of the GCMs, and are generally found to be consistent with the observed changes; the same is generally true for the responses to changes in stratospheric aerosols from volcanic eruptions. GCM responses to changes in tropospheric sulfate aerosols and solar irradiance also appear consistent with the observed record, although the uncertainty is larger. Greenhouse gas and solar irradiance changes are found to have contributed to a best guess of &#8764;0.8 and &#8764;0.3 K warming over the 1901\u20132005 period, respectively, while sulfate aerosols have contributed a &#8764;0.4 K cooling. This analysis provides an observationally constrained estimate of future warming, which is found to be fairly robust across GCMs. By 2100, a warming of between about 1.5 and 4.5 K can be expected according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A1B emissions scenario.\n\nThese results indicate an emerging constraint for global mean surface temperature responses to external forcings across GCMs, which is corroborated in the observed record. This implies that observationally constrained estimates of past warming and predictions of future warming are indeed becoming robust.",

        "abstract": "The detection and attribution of climate change in the observed record plays a central role in synthesizing our knowledge of the climate system.  Unfortunately, the traditional method for detecting and attributing changes due to multiple forcings requires large numbers of general circulation model (GCM) simulations incorporating different initial conditions and forcing scenarios and these have only been performed with a small number of GCMs.  This paper presents an extension to the fingerprinting technique which permits the inclusion of GCMs in the multi-signal analysis of surface temperature even when the required families of ensembles have not been generated.  This is achieved by fitting a series of energy balance models (EBMs) to the GCM output in order to estimate the temporal response patterns to the various forcings.\n\nThis methodology is applied to the very large Challenge ensemble of 62 simulations of historical climate conducted with the NCAR CCSM 1.4 GCM, as well as some simulations from other GCMs.  Considerable uncertainty exists in the estimates of the parameters in fitted EBMs.  Nevertheless, temporal response patterns from these EBMs are more reliable and the combined EBM time series closely mimics the GCM in the context of transient forcing.  In particular, detection and attribution results from this technique appear self-consistent and consistent with results from other methods provided that all major forcings are included in the analysis.\n\nUsing this technique on the Challenge ensemble, the estimated responses to changes in greenhouse gases, tropospheric sulphate aerosols, and stratospheric volcanic aerosols are all detected in the observed record, but only the response to the tropospheric sulphate aerosols is consistent with the observed record without a scaling of the amplitude.  The estimated GCM response to SOL forcing is inconsistent with the observations.  The result is that the temperature difference of the 1995-2004 decade relative to the 1940-1949 decade can be attributed to greenhouse gas emissions, with a partially offsetting cooling from sulphate emissions and little contribution from natural sources.\n \nThe results support the viability of the new methodology as an extension to current analysis tools for the detection and attribution of climate change which will allow the inclusion of many more GCMs.  Shortcomings remain, however, and so it should not be considered a replacement to traditional techniques.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this work is to assess potential future Antarctic surface\nmass balance changes, the underlying mechanisms, and the impact of these\nchanges on global sea level. To this aim, this paper presents\nsimulations of the Antarctic climate for the end of the 20th and 21st\ncenturies. The simulations were carried out with a stretched-grid\natmospheric general circulation model, allowing for high horizontal\nresolution (60 km) over Antarctica. The simulated present-day surface\nmass balance is evaluated. It is found that the simulation is good on\ncontinental scales. Errors on regional scales are moderate when observed\nsea surface conditions are used; more significant regional biases appear\nwhen sea surface conditions from a coupled model run are prescribed. The\nsimulated Antarctic surface mass balance increases by 20 mm water\nequivalent per year in the next century, corresponding to a sea level\ndecrease of 0.78 mm yr-1 by the end of the 21st century. This surface\nmass balance increase is largely due to precipitation changes, while\nchanges in snow melt and turbulent latent surface fluxes are weak. The\ntemperature increase leads to an increased moisture transport towards\nthe interior of the continent because of the higher moisture holding\ncapacity of warmer air, but changes in atmospheric dynamics, in\nparticular off the Antarctic coast, regionally modulate this signal.",

        "abstract": "A new physically-based distributed surface mass balance model is presented for Alpine glaciers. The model resolves both the temporal and spatial variability of the energy and mass balance of glaciers. Mass balance reconstructions for the 1981-2004 period are produced for St Solrin and Argenti\u00e8re glaciers (French Alps). Both glaciers lost mass at an accelerated rate in the last 23 years. With the model, glacier sensitivity to climate change can be separately evaluated with respect to a full range of meteorological parameters, contrary to simpler models that only account for temperature and precipitation. The sensitivity of the equilibrium line altitude to air temperature is found to be 125 m/K, or 160 m/K if concurrent long-wave radiation change is taken into account. Long-term simulations over 1800-2165 are carried out using IPCC AR4 GCM output. St Sorlin glacier is likely to vanish before 2100.",

        "title": "Climate Scenarios for California",
        "abstract": "Possible future climate changes in California are investigated from a varied set of climate change model simulations. These simulations, conducted by three state-of-the-art global climate models, provide trajectories from three greenhouse gas (GHG) emission scenarios. These scenarios and the resulting climate simulations are not \"predictions,\" but rather are a limited sample from among the many plausible pathways that may affect California's climate. Future GHG concentrations are uncertain because they depend on future social, political, and technological pathways, and thus the IPCC has produced four \"families\" of emission scenarios. To explore some of these uncertainties, emissions scenarios A2 (a medium-high emissions) and B1 (low emissions) were selected from the current IPCC Fourth climate assessment, wich provides several recent model simulations driven by A2 and B1 emissions. The global climate model simulations addressed here were from PCM1, the Parallel Climate Model from the Natinoal Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) group, and CM2.1 from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Geophysical Fluids Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL). \n\nAs part of the scenarios assessment, a statistical technique using properties of historical weather data was employed to correct model biases and \"downscale\" the global-model simulation of future climates to a finer level of detail, onto a grid of approximately 7 miles (12 kilometers), which is more suitable for impact studies at the scales needed by California decision makers. \n\nIn current climate-change simulations, temperatures over California warm significantly during the twenty-first century, with the temperature increases from approximately +3 deg F (1.5 deg C) in the lower emissions scenario (B1) withing the less responsive model (PCM1) to +8 deg F (4.5 deg C) in the higher emissions scenario (A2) within the more responsive model (CM2.1). Three of the simulations (all except the low-emission scenario run of the low-response model) exhibit more warming in summer than in winter. \n\nIn all of the simulations, most precipitation continues to occur in winter, with virtually all derived from North Pacific winter storms. Relatively little change in overall precipitation is projected. Climate warming has a profound influence in diminishing snow accumulations, because there is more rain and less snow, and earlier snowmelt. These snow losses increase as the warming increases, so that they are most severe under climate changes projected by the more sensitive model with the higher GHG emissions. \n",

        "title": "Projecting Future Sea Level",
        "abstract": "California's coastal observations and global model projections indicate that California's open coast and estuaries will experience increasing sea levels over the next century. Sea level rise has affected much of the coast of California, including the Southern California coast, the Central California open coast, and the San Francisco Bay and upper estuary. These trends, quantified from a small set of California tide gages, have ranged from 10-20 centimeters (cm) {3.9-7.9 inces} per century, quite similar to that estimated for global mean sea level. So far, there is little evidence that the rate of rise has accelerated, and the rate of rise at California tide gages has actually flattened since 1980, but projections suggest substantial sea level rise may occur over the next century. \n\nClimate change simulations project a substantial rate of global sea level rise over the next century due to thermal expansion as the oceans warm and runoff from melting land-based snow and ice accelerates. Sea level rise projected from the models increases with the amount of warming. Relative to sea levels in 2000, by the 2070-2099 period, sea level rise projections range from 11-54 cm {4.3-21 in} for simulations following the lower (B1) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions scenario, from 14-61 cm {5.5-24 in} for the middle-upper (A2) emission scenario, and from 17-72 cm {6.7-28 in} for the highest (A1fi) scenario. In addition to relatively steady secular trends, sea levels along the California coast undergo shorter period variability over or below predicted tide levels and changes associated with long-term trends. These variations are caused by weather events and by seasonal to decadal climate fluctuations over the Pacific Ocean that in turn affect the Pacific coast. Highest coastal sea levels have occurred when winter storms and Pacific climate disturbances, such as El Nino, have coincided with high astronomical tides. \n\nThis study considers a range of projected future global sea level rises in examining possible impacts at California coastal and estuarine stations. Two climate models and three scenarios considered in this scenarios study provide a set of possible future weather and short-period climate fluctuations, and a range of potential long-term sea level rise values. A range of mean sea level rise was considered in combination with weather and El Nino fluctuations extracted from two global climate models and two GHG emissions scenarios. The mean sea level rise values, determined from a survey of several climate models, range from approximately 10-80 cm {3.9-31 in} between 2000 and 2100. The middle to higher end of this range would substantially exceed the historical rate of sea level rise of 15-20 cm {5.9-7.9 in} per century observed at San Francisco and San Diego during the last 100 years. Gradual sea level rise progressively worsens the impacts of high tides and the surge and waves associated with storms. The potential for impacts of future sea level rise was assessed from the occurrence of hourly sea level extremes. The occurrence of extreme events follows a sharply escalating pattern as the magnitude of future sea level rise increases. The confluence of low barometric pressures from storms and the presence large waves at the same time substantially increases the likelihood of high, damaging sea levels along the California coast. Similarly, astronomical tides and disturbances in sea level that are caused by weather and climate fluctuations are transmitted into the San Francisco Bay and Delta, and on into the lower reaches of the Sacramento River. In addition to elevating Bay and Delta sea levels directly through inverse barometer and wind effects, storms may generate heavy precipitation and high fresh water runoff and cause floods in the Sacramento/San Joaquin Delta, increasing the potential for inundation of levees and other structures. There may also be increased risk of levee failure due to the hydraulics and geometry of these structures. Rising sea levels from climate change will increase the frequency and duration of extremem high water levels, causing historical coastal and San Francisco Bay/Delta structure design criteria to be exceeded. \n",

        "title": "Scenarios of Climate Change in California: An Overview",
        "abstract": "Summary of Key Findings and Recommendations\n\n - Climate change impacts will affect all of the sectors considered in this report: sea-level rise, agriculture, snowpack and water supply, forestry, wildfire risk, public health, and electricity demand and supply. \n\n - The more that greenhouse gases (GHGs) accumulate in the Earth's atmosphere over the next century, the greater the warming and the more severe and costly the impacts will be. This study considered three future GHG emissions scenarios - low, medium high, and high emissions - and explored associated climate changes through three modern climate models of differing sensitivity to GHG concentrations. \n\n - Although climate model results are inconclusive as to whether California's precipitation will change over the next century, all climate models show increases in temperature, with the aggregate of several model runs containing a range of warming from 2000 to 2100 from about +2 deg C to about +6 deg C (+3.6 deg F to about +10.8 deg F). Increases in temperature alone would impact the California hydrological cycle, with consequences upon the state's water supply, hydroelectric power supply, agriculture, recreation, and ecosystems. \n\n - Climate change could produce compounding impacts - for instance, in the San Francisco Bay Delta, heightened sea levels and high river inflows from warmer storms would place levee systems in greater jeopardy of flooding. \n\n - Some of the most dramatic climate change impacts will be experienced as increased freqeuncy and severity of extreme events, such as heat waves, wildfires, flooding, and conditions conducive to air pollution formation. \n\n - Even under lower GHG emissions scenarios, some impacts of climate change are inevitable. As a result, although adaptation is not the solution to climate change, it is a necessary complementary stategy to manage some of the projected impacts. \n\n - Although there are many opportunities for California to increase its capacity to cope with many climate change impacts, these can be costly, and they require time and planning. \n\n - More analysis - and in some cases, more information - is needed to better understand the vulnerability of California's health, economy, and environment to climate change. In particular, greater attention must focus on social dimensions of climate change for both assessing and implementing the state's mitigative and adaptive potential. Critical to this work will be evaluating and addressing the distributional and equity implications of climate changes in California. \n",

        "title": "Agricultural drought in a future climate: results from 15 GCMs participating in the IPCC AR4",
        "abstract": "This study examines the impact of greenhouse gas warming on soil moisture based on predictions of fifteen global climate models by comparing the after-stabilization climate in the SRESA1b experiment with the pre-industrial control climate. The models are consistent in predicting summer dryness and winter wetness in only part of the northern middle and high latitudes. Slightly over half of the models predict year-round wetness in central Eurasia and/or year-round dryness in Siberia and mid-latitude Northeast Asia. One explanation is offered that relates such lack of seasonality to the carry-over effect of soil moisture storage from season to season. In the tropics and subtropics, a decrease of soil moisture is the dominant response. The models are especially consistent in predicting drier soil over the US Southwest, the Mediterranean, Australia, and the South Africa in all seasons, and over much of the Amazon and West Africa in the JJA season and the Asian monsoon region in the DJF season. Since the only major areas of future wetness predicted with a high level of model consistency are part of the northern middle and high latitudes during the non-growing season, it is suggested that greenhouse gas warming will cause a worldwide agricultural drought. Over regions where there are considerable consistency among the analyzed models in predicting the sign of soil moisture changes, there is a wide range of magnitudes of the soil moisture response, indicating a high degree of model dependency in terrestrial hydrological sensitivity. A major part of the inter-model differences in the sensitivity of soil moisture response are attributable to differences in land surface parameterization.",

An urgent quesiton is: Are the IPCC AR4 projections substantially different from previous projections? An ensemble of 84 AR4 projections of California climate change from 12 models responding to 3 greenhouse-gas emission scenarios was resampled to estimate projection distribution functions (pdfs). An 18-member ensemble from the IPCC 3rd Assessment Report (AR3) was similarly evaluated. Comparisons of AR4 and AR3 pdfs show that scatter within the AR3 and AR4 temperature and precipitation ensembles do not noticeably differ by end of the 21st Century, despite the larger size of the AR4 ensemble; precipitation projections for northern California are even more stationary in AR4 than in AR3; and AR4 warmings are generally 0.85 deg C less than AR3 because of the different models and emissions scenarios used. \n",

        "abstract": "Ocean thermal expansion contributes signi&#64257;cantly to sea-level variability and rise. However, observed decadal variability in ocean heat content and sea level has not been reproduced well in climate models. Aerosols injected into the stratosphere during volcanic eruptions scatter incoming solar radiation, and cause a rapid cooling of the atmosphere and a reduction in rainfall, as well as other changes in the climate system. Here we use observations of ocean heat content and a set of climate simulations to show that large volcanic eruptions result in rapid reductions in ocean heat content and global mean sea level. For the Mt Pinatubo eruption, we estimate a reduction in ocean heat content of about 3 x 10^22 J and a global sea-level fall of about 5 mm. Over the three years following such an eruption, we estimate a decrease in evaporation of up to 0.1 mm d^-1, comparable to observed changes in mean land precipitation. The recovery of sea level following the Mt Pinatubo eruption in 1991 explains about half of the difference between the long-term rate of sea-level rise of 1.8 mm yr^-1 (for 1950\u20132000), and the higher rate estimated for the more recent period where satellite altimeter data are available (1993\u20132000).

        "abstract": "The South Asian High (SAH) and precipitation over East Asia simulated by 11 coupled GCMs associated with the forthcoming Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s (IPCC) 4th Assessment Report are evaluated. The seasonal behavior of the SAH is presented for each model. Analyses of the results show that all models are able to reproduce the seasonal cycle of the SAH. Locations of the SAH center are also basically reproduced by these models. All models underestimate the intensity and the extension of coverage in summer. The anomalous SAH can be divided into east and west modes according to its longitudinal position in summer on the interannual timescale, and the composite anomalies of the observed precipitation for these two modes tend to have opposite signs over East Asia. However, only several coupled GCMs can simulate the relationship between rainfall and SAH similar to the observed one, which may be associated with the bias in simulation of the subtropical anticyclone over the West Pacific (SAWP) at 500 hPa. In fact, it is found that any coupled GCM, that can reproduce the reasonable summer mean state of SAWP and the southward (northward) withdrawal (extension) for the east (west) mode of SAH as compared to the observed, will also simulate similar rainfall anomaly patterns for the east and west SAH modes over East Asia. Further analysis indicates that the observed variations in the SAH, SAWP and rainfall are closely related to the sea surface temperature (SST) over the equatorial tropical Pacific. Particularly, some models cannot simulate the SAWP extending northward in the west mode and withdrawing southward in the east mode, which may be related to weak major El  Nino or La  events. The abilities of the coupled GCMs to simulate the SAWP and ENSO events are associated partly with their ability to reproduce the observed relationship between SAH and the rainfall anomaly over East Asia.",

Over the Saint Sorlin glacier in the french Alps, this\nmass balance has also been modelled with the help of meteorological\nreconstructions (SAFRAN model) by feeding a pronostic snow cover model\n(CROCUS). Results of a 2D semi-implicit ice flow model driven by both\nmeasured and modelled mass balance series are here compared over the\n1981-2004 period. Although it hardly changes the global\nglacier behaviour, modelled mass balance\ncan however exhibit different values especially over poorly-measured\nareas, and these differences may locally give a more realistic pattern\nof the glacier dynamics.\nMoreover, this modelled approach is the only means of predicting the\nfuture mass balance of the glacier from which the\nglacier changes over the forthcoming decades can be computed.\n",

        "abstract": "\tProbabilistic forecasts of near-term climate change are derived by using a multi-model ensemble of climate change simulations and a simple resampling technique that increases the number of realizations for the possible combination of anthropogenic climate change and internal climate variability. The technique is based on the assumption that the probability distribution of local climate changes is only a function of the all-model mean global average warming. Although this is unlikely to be exactly true, cross-verification indicates that the resulting biases are more than compensated by the increased sample size provided by the method. The resulting forecasts for southern Finland suggest a 95% probability of annual mean warming and an 80% probability of increased annual mean precipitation from the years 1971-2000 to 2011-2020 under the SRES A1B emissions scenario. The choice of the emissions scenario is unimportant for such short-term forecasts but becomes gradually more important towards the late 21st century.  The simulations also suggest that the probability of near-term warming that is large enough to be discernible from internal variability is largest in the tropics where internal temperature variability is small, not in the Arctic where the average model-simulated warming is largest.

        "abstract": "Simulations by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report\n(AR4) models on the Southern Hemisphere (SH) circulation are assessed over the period 1950\u201399, focusing\non the seasonality of the trend and the level of its congruency with the southern annular mode (SAM) in\nterms of surface zonal wind stress. It is found that, as a group, the models realistically produce the\nseasonality of the trend, which is strongest in the SH summer season, December\u2013February (DJF). The\nmodeled DJF trend is principally congruent with the modeled SAM trend, as in observations. The majority\nof models produce a statistically significant positive trend, with decreasing westerlies in the midlatitudes and\nincreasing westerlies in the high latitudes. The trend pattern from an all-experiment mean achieves highest\ncorrelation with that from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) data. A total of 48\nout of the 71 experiments were run with ozone-depletion forcing, which offers an opportunity to assess the\nimportance of ozone depletion in driving the late-twentieth-century trends. The AR4 model ensemble that\ncontains an ozone-depletion forcing produces an averaged trend that is comparable to the trend from the\nNCEP outputs corrected by station-based observations. The trend is largely generated after the mid-1970s.\nWithout ozone depletion the trend is less than half of that in the corrected NCEP, although the errors in\nthe observed trend are large. The impact on oceanic circulation is inferred from wind stress curl in the group\nwith ozone-depletion forcing. The result shows an intensification of the southern midlatitude supergyre\ncirculation, including a strengthening East Australian Current flowing through the Tasman Sea. Thus, ozone\ndepletion also plays an important role in the subtropical gyre circulation change over the past decades.",

        "abstract": "The estimated range of climate sensitivity has remained unchanged for decades and recently even increased, resulting in large uncertainties in long-term projections of future climate under increased greenhouse gas concentrations. Here we use the multi-thousand member ensemble of climate model simulations from the climateprediction.net project and a neural network to establish a relation between climate sensitivity and the amplitude of the seasonal cycle in regional temperature. Most models with high sensitivities are found to overestimate the seasonal cycle compared to observations. A probability density function for climate sensitivity is then calculated from the present day seasonal cycle in reanalysis and instrumental datasets. Subject to a number of assumptions on the models and datasets used, we find that climate sensitivity is very unlikely (5% probability) to be either below  1.5 to 2 K or above about 5 to 6.5 K, with the best agreement found for sensitivities between 3 and 3.5 K.  This range is narrower than most probabilistic estimates derived from the observed 20th century warming. The current generation of general circulation models are within that range but do not sample the highest values.\n\n \n",

        "abstract": "In the 20th century, we have faced condition that green house gases (GHGs) concentration, particularly CO2, in the atmosphere has increased so tremendously. Regarding to the effects, IPCC (2001) has shown many proofs about the raising of global temperature and the changing of other climate parameters such as rainfall, humidity, etc. Generally, it gives specific influence to the distribution of rainfall patterns regionally or even locally. The study based on general idea to learn the relationship of the increasing of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere to the changing of rainfall patterns in Indonesia on regional and local point of views. \n\tIn the first part of our research, we were focusing our study in developing regionalization techniques. We have developed and practiced some of statistical downscaling methods and select the best method that statistically produces the best result on reconstructing Indonesian rainfall. The selected method also will be use to estimate the future rainfall based on GCMs scenario data as well as the historical rainfall. The study compared three statistical downscaling methods; they are Principal Component Regression (PCR), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS). These methods were formulated using historical precipitable water (prw) data from different GCM models (CSIRO-Mk3.0, CGCM3.1, ECHAM5 and GFDL-CM2.0) which used to downscale the observation rainfall data in Aceh, Padang, Solok, Lampung, Jakarta, Kupang, Pontianak, and Ambon. We suggest that MARS method has given better performance rather than PCR and ANN methods. The study also found that the reducing of GCMs gridded data using principal component analysis for the six data of observed areas produces >80% of total variants for the first five or six components. The study of historical rainfall shown that in a century DJF rainfall pattern in Padang changed gradually as well as in Aceh on JJA and SON patterns, and in Jakarta on DJF pattern. \n",

        "abstract": "[1] Stratospheric sulfate aerosol particles from strong volcanic eruptions produce\nsignificant transient cooling of the troposphere and warming of the lower stratosphere. The\nradiative impact of volcanic aerosols also produces a response that generally includes an\nanomalously positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation (AO) that is most pronounced in\nthe boreal winter. The main atmospheric thermal and dynamical effects of eruptions\ntypical of the past century persist for about two years after each eruption. In this paper we\nevaluate the volcanic responses in simulations produced by seven of the climate models\nincluded in the model intercomparison conducted as part of the preparation of the\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4).\nWe consider global effects as well as the regional circulation effects in the extratropical\nNorthern Hemisphere focusing on the AO responses forced by volcanic eruptions.\nSpecifically we analyze results from the IPCC historical runs that simulate the evolution of\nthe circulation over the last part of the 19th century and the entire 20th century using a\nrealistic time series of atmospheric composition (greenhouse gases and aerosols). In\nparticular, composite anomalies over the two boreal winters following each of the nine\nlargest low-latitude eruptions during the period 1860\u20131999 are computed for various\ntropospheric and stratospheric fields. These are compared when possible with\nobservational data. The seven IPCC models we analyzed use similar assumptions about\nthe amount of volcanic aerosols formed in the lower stratosphere following the volcanic\neruptions that have occurred since 1860. All models produce tropospheric cooling and\nstratospheric warming as in observations. However, they display a considerable range of\ndynamic responses to volcanic aerosols. Nevertheless, some general conclusions can be\ndrawn. The IPCC models tend to simulate a positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation in\nresponse to volcanic forcing similar to that typically observed. However, the associated\ndynamic perturbations and winter surface warming over Northern Europe and Asia in the\npost-volcano winters is much weaker in the models than in observations. The AR4\nmodels also underestimate the variability and long-term trend of the AO. This deficiency\naffects high-latitude model predictions and may have a similar origin. This analysis allows\nus to better evaluate volcanic impacts in up-to-date climate models and to better\nquantify the model Arctic Oscillation sensitivity to external forcing. This potentially could\nlead to improving model climate predictions in the extratropical latitudes of the Northern\nHemisphere.",

        "abstract": "Projections of changes in climate extremes are critical to assessing the potential impacts of climate change on human and natural systems. Modeling advances now provide the opportunity of utilizing global general circulation models (GCMs) for projections of extreme temperature and precipitation indicators. We analyze historical and future simulations of ten such indicators as derived from an ensemble of 8 GCMs contributing to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC-AR4), under a range of emissions scenarios. Our focus is on the consensus from the GCM ensemble, in terms of direction and significance of the changes, at the global average and geographical scale. The climate extremes described by the ten indices range from heat-wave frequency to frost-day occurrence, from dry-spell length to heavy rainfall amounts. Historical trends generally agree with previous observational studies, providing a basic sense of reliability for the GCM simulations. Projections for the 21st century are unanimous in confirming the changes in most temperature indices that are expected within a warmer climate, with differences in the spatial distribution of the changes and in the rates of the trends detected across scenarios. Depiction of a wetter world emerges unequivocally in the global averages of most of the precipitation indices. However, consensus and significance are less strong when regional patterns are concerned. This analysis provides a first overview of projected changes in climate extremes from the IPCC-AR4 model ensemble, and has significant implications with regard to climate projections for impact assessments.

Here we analyze a multi-model AOGCM data set to examine processes that produce the geographic pattern of these precipitation intensity changes over land. In the tropics, general increases in water vapor associated with positive SST anomalies in the warmer climate produce increased precipitation intensity over most land areas. In the midlatitudes, the pattern of precipitation intensity increase is related in part to the increased water vapor being carried to areas of mean moisture convergence to produce greater precipitation, as well as to changes in atmospheric circulation. Advective effects, indicated by sea level pressure changes, contribute to greatest precipitation intensity increases (as well as mean precipitation increases) over northwestern and northeastern North America, northern Europe, northern Asia, the east coast of Asia, southeastern Australia, and south-central South America.",

        "abstract": "Satellite gravimetric observations of monthly changes in continental water storage are compared with outputs from five climate models. All models qualitatively reproduce the global pattern of annual storage amplitude, and the seasonal cycle of global average storage is reproduced well, consistent with earlier studies. However, global average agreements mask systematic model biases in low latitudes. Seasonal extrema of low-latitude, hemispheric storage generally occur too early in the models, and model-specific errors in amplitude of the low-latitude annual variations are substantial. These errors are potentially explicable in terms of neglected or suboptimally parameterized water stores in the land models and precipitation biases in the climate models.",

        "abstract": "A group of twelve IPCC fourth assessment report (AR4) climate models have Arctic (60N\u201390N) warmings that are, on average, 1.9 times greater than their global warmings at the time of CO2 doubling in 1%/year CO2 increase experiments. Forcings and feedbacks that impact the warming response are estimated for both Arctic and global regions based on standard model diagnostics. Fitting a zero-dimensional energy balance model to each region, an expression is derived that gives the Arctic amplification as a function of these forcings and feedbacks. Contributing to Arctic amplification are the Arctic-global differences in surface albedo feedback (SAF), longwave feedback and the net top-of-atmosphere flux forcing (the sum of the surface flux and the atmospheric heat transport convergence). The doubled CO2 forcing and non-SAF shortwave feedback oppose Arctic amplification. SAF is shown to be a contributing, but not a dominating, factor in the simulated Arctic amplification and its intermodel variation.",

        "abstract": "A simple technique is proposed for calculating global mean climate forcing from transient integrations of coupled atmosphere\u2013ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs). This \u201cclimate forcing\u201d differs from the conventionally defined radiative forcing as it includes semidirect effects that account for certain short time scale responses in the troposphere. First, a climate feedback term is calculated from reported values of 2 \u00d7 CO2 radiative forcing and surface temperature time series from 70-yr simulations by 20 AOGCMs. In these simulations carbon dioxide is increased by 1% yr&#8722;1. The derived climate feedback agrees well with values that are diagnosed from equilibrium climate change experiments of slab-ocean versions of the same models. These climate feedback terms are associated with the fast, quasi-linear response of lapse rate, clouds, water vapor, and albedo to global surface temperature changes. The importance of the feedbacks is gauged by their impact on the radiative fluxes at the top of the atmosphere. Partial compensation is found between longwave and shortwave feedback terms that lessens the intermodel differences in the equilibrium climate sensitivity. There is also some indication that the AOGCMs overestimate the strength of the positive longwave feedback.\n\nThese feedback terms are then used to infer the shortwave and longwave time series of climate forcing in twentieth- and twenty-first-century simulations in the AOGCMs. The technique is validated using conventionally calculated forcing time series from four AOGCMs. In these AOGCMs the shortwave and longwave climate forcings that are diagnosed agree with the conventional forcing time series within &#8764;10%. The shortwave forcing time series exhibit order of magnitude variations between the AOGCMs, differences likely related to how both natural forcings and/or anthropogenic aerosol effects are included. There are also factor of 2 differences in the longwave climate forcing time series, which may indicate problems with the modeling of well-mixed greenhouse gas changes. The simple diagnoses presented provides an important and useful first step for understanding differences in AOGCM integrations, indicating that some of the differences in model projections can be attributed to different prescribed climate forcing, even for so-called standard climate change scenarios.\n",

        "abstract": "The need of soybean in Indonesia grows from time to time. Now, Indonesia imports at about 1,1 milion ton/ha yearly. This condition indicates that the need of soybean in Indonesia can be a serious problem of agricultural sector in the future. Furthermore, the climate change issue as a result of human activity used a large amount of fosil fuel will derive a new problem for agricultural sector which requires a better strategy of anticipation. This point out the important of information in order to estimate the potential of soybean\u2019s yield in Indoensia in the future. \nIn general, this research is designed to identify the evidence of climate change and to learn the impact of the climate change scenarios on the future of soybean\u2019s yield in Bandung district. For this purpose, literature study and analysis of global circulation model (data) data are applied for identifying the occurrence of climate change. Then, the impact analysis of these scenarios on soybean\u2019s yield is conducted by using climate and agricultural simulation model, which consist of statistic and mechanistic models.\n Analysis of the earth surface mean temperature shows the increasing of global air temperature has been started since 19\u2019s century with the occurence of increasing temperature from about -0.4 oC to about 0.1 oC in the year of 1940\u2019s. Then, the occurence of climate change in Indonesia can be identified using monthly rainfall data for a certain period. Previous study, which has been conducted by kaimuddin (2000) shows the changing of rainfall pattern in Indonesia.\nAdditionally, analysis on GCM data for various climate change scenarios reveal the evidence of rainfall and temperature changing variability in percentage for each model in 2020, 2050 and 2080. The highest value of A2 scenario in come from NIESS, meanwhile for B2 scenario is GFDL. Then, the minimum value is mostly gained from ECHAM model. Moreover, the result of simulation using  maximum and minimum value from those scenario  for year 2020 decrease in almost of the whole area of Bandung.\n",

        "title": "Assessing snow albedo feedback in simulated climate change",
        "abstract": "We isolate and quantify the two factors controlling Northern Hemisphere springtime snow albedo feedback in transient climate change based on scenario runs of 17 climate models used in the IPCC 4th Assessment.  The first factor is the dependence of planetary albedo on surface albedo, representing the atmosphere's attenuation effect on surface albedo anomalies.  It is potentially a major source of divergence in simulations of snow albedo feedback because of large differences in simulated cloud fields in Northern Hemisphere land areas.  To calculate it, we develop an analytical model governing planetary albedo.  We show detailed validation of the analytical model for two of the simulations, CCSM3.0 and CM2.0, demonstrating that it facilitates highly accurate calculation of the dependence of planetary albedo on surface albedo given readily-available simulation output.  We find in all simulations surface albedo anomalies are attenuated by approximately half in Northern Hemisphere land areas as they are transformed into planetary albedo anomalies.   The intermodel standard deviation in this factor is surprisingly small, less than 10% of the mean.  Moreover, when we calculate an observational estimate of this factor by applying the same method to the satellite-based ISCCP data, we find most simulations agree with ISCCP values to within about 10%, in spite of further disagreements between observed and simulated cloud fields.  This suggests even large relative errors in simulated cloud fields do not result in significant error in this factor, enhancing confidence in climate models.  The second factor, related exclusively to surface processes, is the change in surface albedo associated with an anthropogenically-induced temperature change in Northern Hemisphere land areas.  It exhibits much more intermodel variability.  Its standard deviation is about 1/3 of the mean, with the largest value being approximately three times larger than the smallest.  Therefore this factor is unquestionably the main source of the large divergence in simulations of snow albedo feedback.  To reduce the divergence, attention should be focused on differing parameterizations of snow processes, rather than intermodel variations in the attenuation effect of the atmosphere on surface albedo anomalies.",

        "title": "Using the current seasonal cycle to constrain snow albedo feedback in future climate change",
        "abstract": "Differences in simulations of climate feedbacks are sources of significant divergence in climate models' temperature response to anthropogenic forcing.  Snow albedo feedback is particularly critical for climate change prediction in heavily-populated northern hemisphere land masses.  Here we show its strength in current models exhibits a factor-of-three spread.  These large intermodel variations in feedback strength in climate change are nearly perfectly correlated with comparably large intermodel variations in feedback strength in the context of the seasonal cycle.  Moreover, the feedback strength in the real seasonal cycle can be measured and compared to simulated values.  These mostly fall outside the range of the observed estimate, suggesting many models have an unrealistic snow albedo feedback in the seasonal cycle context.  Because of the tight correlation between simulated feedback strength in the seasonal cycle and climate change, eliminating the model errors in the seasonal cycle will lead directly to a reduction in the spread of feedback strength in climate change.  Though this comparison to observations may put the models in an unduly harsh light because of uncertainties in the observed estimate that are difficult to quantify, our results map out a clear strategy for targeted observation of the seasonal cycle to reduce divergence in simulations of climate sensitivity.",

        "abstract": "We examine the annular mode within each hemisphere (defined here as the leading empirical orthogonal function and principal component of hemispheric sea level pressure) as simulated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report ensembles of coupled ocean-atmosphere models. The simulated annular patterns exhibit a high spatial correlation with the observed patterns during the late 20th century, though the mode represents too large a percentage of total temporal variability within each hemisphere. In response to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases and tropospheric sulfate aerosols, the multimodel average exhibits a positive annular trend in both hemispheres, with decreasing sea level pressure (SLP) over the pole and a compensating increase in midlatitudes. In the Northern Hemisphere, the trend agrees in sign but is of smaller amplitude than that observed during recent decades. In the Southern Hemisphere, decreasing stratospheric ozone causes an additional reduction in Antarctic surface pressure during the latter half of the 20th century. While annular trends in the multimodel average are positive, individual model trends vary widely. Not all models predict a decrease in high-latitude SLP, although no model exhibits an increase. As a test of the models' annular sensitivity, the response to volcanic aerosols in the stratosphere is calculated during the winter following five major tropical eruptions. The observed response exhibits coupling between stratospheric anomalies and annular variations at the surface, similar to the coupling between these levels simulated elsewhere by models in response to increasing GHG concentration. The multimodel average is of the correct sign but significantly smaller in magnitude than the observed annular anomaly. This suggests that the models underestimate the coupling of stratospheric changes to annular variations at the surface and may not simulate the full response to increasing GHGs.",

We compare Sahel rainfall in the 20th century, pre-industrial, and increased greenhouse gases (GHG) simulations produced for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The simulations forced by 20th century concentrations of aerosol and GHG reproduce (i) a global change in SST akin to that associated with Sahel drought and (ii) a correspondent drying of the Sahel. We conclude that late 20th century Sahel climate was significantly dryer than pre-industrial, and at least 30% of the drying was externally forced. Comparison between 20th century runs and runs forced by GHG alone reveals the key role of reflective aerosols: they force a gradient in SST that excites robust drying in the northern edge of the Atlantic Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and in the Sahel.

In this paper, for the common period 1960-2000, the mean, standard deviation and mean square error between the grid point from different models and the nearest station was calculated. The indices that could be comparable are: FD: annual occurrence of frost days (days with MinT <0\u00baC), Tn90: percentage of days where MinT was above the 90th percentile of the 1961-90 base period. R10: number of heavy precipitation days > 10mm (R10), CDD: consecutive dry days  and R5D: maximum 5-day precipitation.  The available models are CCSM3 (CCSM),USA CNRM-CM3, (CNRM), France GFDL-CM2 .0 (GFDL0) GFDL-CM2.1 (GFDL), USA, INM-CM3.0-Russia (INM), MIROC high-resolution MIROC), MIROC medre-resolution (MIRMED), Japan, and PCM, USA (PCM)\nIn general, it is necessary to think that the values of the models on the Andes cannot be evaluated by the failing of the models in interpreting the orography. If we center the analysis in the Southeast of South America,  a low land region  which has more dense information, one sees that the average value is well simulated, the station values has similar values over regions, and are of the same order of magnitude, as in case of the models. In some cases, as the model GFDL, FD's average values are well simulated. The interannual variability from days to weeks in average, also is in good agreement.  Another temperature extreme, a warm one, Tn90, (being an index percentile-based, is relative to the local climate), It seems to be better represented that the FD. The consecutive dry days are more difficult to be simulated, since the region has a marked precipitation gradient that is not properly represented. The maximums of dryness over central Argentina Andes could not be represented for any model. On the other hand, the extensive dry season of the Amazon, is displeased and exaggerated in GFDL, whereas it does not exist for CCSM3. An index that measures the quantity of extreme rainfall, (R5d) shows in all the models that the quantity of rainfall is underestimated and there the differences of rate of rainfall are not clear. The one that better approaches the average values is the MIROC3.2. When the number of days is evaluated by extreme rainfall (R10), without considering how much it precipitated, the maps are more similar. The Amazon interannual variability is well  simulated.\n",

        "abstract": "Simulations from six climate system models are analyzed to investigate the ENSO amplitude changes in response to a transient increase of the atmospheric CO2. It is found that the ENSO amplitude amplifies as the CO2 concentration increases, then weakens once the concentration is held fixed at 2xCO2 level in the Meteorological Research Institute (MRI) model simulation, but with no significant sensitivity in the other five models. By comparing the MRI and the Geophysical Fluid Dynamical Laboratory (GFDL) models, both of which simulate ENSO reasonably well for the unperturbed climate, we investigate the origin of the sensitivity or lack of sensitivity of the ENSO amplitude to changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration. It is found that in the MRI model the oceanic sensitivity to the equatorial zonal wind stress is significantly decreased in the doubled CO2 period compared to the transient period. Moreover, the vertical stratification at upper levels is weaker in the former period than in the latter period. However, these changes in the GFDL model are negligible.",

The energy cycle consists of the net energy fluxes at the top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) and the surface, the atmospheric energy storage rates over the global land and ocean, and the atmospheric energy transport between the land and ocean. The energy cycle was investigated using a multi-model ensemble for its centennial mean, climatological annual variation and long-term trend. Some distinctive features of the cycle were revealed: (1) the ocean-to-land atmospheric energy transport plays a key role in partitioning the global net TOA flux between the ocean and land, (2) the annual variation of the global net TOA flux is primarily attributed by the ocean surface flux, and (3) it is ascertained that the planetary energy imbalance on the long-term period is induced by the ocean\u2019s heat uptake.

        "title": "Intrinsic Versus Forced Variation in Coupled Climate Model Simulations over the Arctic during the 20th Century",
        "abstract": "There were two major multi-year, Arctic-wide (60-90&#61616;N) warm anomalies (> 0.7&#61616;C) in land surface air temperature (LSAT) during the 20th century, between 1920-1950 and again at the end of the century (after 1979). Reproducing this decadal variability in coupled General Circulation Models (GCMs) is a critical test for understanding processes in the Arctic climate system and increasing the confidence in the IPCC model projections. Our study evaluated 63 realizations generated by 20 coupled GCMs made available for the IPCC 4th Assessment for their 20th century simulations (20C3M) and corresponding control runs (PIcntrl). Warm anomalies in the Arctic during the last two decades are reproduced by all ensemble members, but with considerable variability in magnitude among models. Eight models generated warm anomalies at least 2/3 of the observed mid-century warm event in at least one realization but not their timing. However, the durations of the early warm event in all the models are shorter than the observed.  Large region-to-region, year-to-year, ensemble to ensemble, and model to model variability are seen in the simulations. These results suggest that the observed mid-century warm period is consistent with intrinsic climate variability, and one should not expect each ensemble member to have a year-to-year correspondence to the observed time series. Further, the variance of the control runs in nine models was comparable with the variance in the observations. Five models compare favorably to Arctic observations in matching both the variance in their control runs and representing the decadal mean temperature anomaly magnitude in their 20C3M simulation. Seven additional models could be given further consideration. Our results support selecting a subset of GCMs when making predictions for future climate by using performance criteria based on comparison with retrospective data. ",

        "title": "Novel methods for inferring future changes in extreme rainfall over northern Europe",
        "abstract": "Empirical studies show that the frequency distribution, n_P, with respect to daily precipitation amount, P, can for a large number of location be approximated by an exponential law, n_P is proportional to exp(m P), with negative values for the exponential coefficient, m. Furthermore, the exponential coefficient is not a constant but varies from location to location and exhibits a systematic relationship with the local mean temperature and precipitation as well as other geographical parameters. These properties allow an estimation of extreme values in form of high percentiles, once the mean conditions are known. Furthermore, given changes in the mean local climate, it is possible to infer changes in the extremes. A new multi-model ensemble of the most recent climate simulations, carried out for the next Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, due to be published in 2007 (the fourth assessment report - AR4), has been subject to empirical-statistical downscaling and provides best-estimates for the continuing trends in mean temperatures and precipitation in northern Europe. These scenarios are used in conjunction with the established relationship between the exponential coefficient m of the distribution function on the one hand, and local mean temperature and precipitation for year 2050 based on previous work on the other, to infer changes in the 95-percentiles of the rainfall for year 2050. This approach is different to previous work based on regional climate models or more traditional means of statistical downscaling applied directly to climate extreme indices. This new independent analysis points towards an increase in the number of extreme precipitation events and very slight change in the number of rainy days over large parts of the Nordic countries.",

        "abstract": "Large scale changes in the sea level pressure do not necessary reflect changes in the atmospheric moisture budget, and hence may not give a good representation of changes in precipitation as a result of a global warming. Statistical models using both sea level pressure and large-scale precipitation as predictor are evaluated for a number of locations in Fennoscandia. The statistical models in most cases were capable of capturing 60%--80% of the year-to-year seasonal variations in precipitation and a correlation analysis over independent data indicated predictive skills scores in the range 0.2--0.5. A comparison between statistical models based on large-scale precipitation, sea level pressure, and a mixture of these, indicated similar skills in terms of variance and predictive skill of inter-annual variations. Analyses of their ability to capture recent precipitation trends reveal potential problems regarding reconstructing long-term changes in the past. One explanation for why the statistical models do not give similar past trend values as the station observations may partly be that precipitation trends during the most recent 50 years are not well defined because the interval is not sufficiently long. This is supported by the fact that trend analysis for station observations based on two different data products, and different trend-analysis strategies do not correspond well with each other. An analysis of possible non-stationarities between large and local spatial scales does not indicate significant presence of non-stationarities.",

        "abstract": "The amount of solar irradiance reaching the surface is a key parameter in the hydrological and energy cycles of the Earth's climate. We analyze 20th Century simulations using nine state-of-the-art climate models and show that all models estimate a global annual mean reduction in downward surface solar radiation of 1-4 W/m2 at the same time that the globe warms by 0.4-0.7\u00b0\u00a6 C. In single forcing simulations using the GISS-ER model, this \"global dimming\" signal is shown to be predominantly related to aerosol effects. In the global mean sense the surface adjusts to changes in downward solar flux instantaneously by reducing the upward fluxes of longwave, latent and sensible heat. Adding increased greenhouse gas forcing traps outgoing longwave radiation in the atmosphere and surface which results in net heating (although reduced) that is consistent with global warming over the 20th Century. Over the 1984-2000 period, individual model simulations show widely disparate results, mostly related to cloud changes associated with tropical Pacific variations, similar to the changes inferred from the satellite data analysis. This suggests that this time period is not sufficient to determine longer term trends.",

        "abstract": "The response of water vapor and clouds to El Ni\u00f1o warming over the tropical Pacific in the most recent three versions of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Atmosphere Model (CAM2, T42 CAM3, and T85 CAM3) is quantified and compared to observations. It is found that all three models have a stronger response in the greenhouse effect of water vapor than that indicated in Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) observations. The overestimate is most severe in the T85 CAM3 (up to 36%). Compared with National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis, all three models have an excessive response of atmospheric moisture content in the upper troposphere, suggesting a cause for the excessive response in the greenhouse effect of water vapor. The response in the greenhouse effect of clouds (the longwave forcing of clouds) in two of the models (CAM2 and T42 CAM3) is significantly weaker than that indicated in ERBE observations, but it is comparable to the observed in the T85 CAM3. The improvement in the T85 CAM3 in simulating the response in the greenhouse effect is helped by a stronger response in the middle level clouds in the model (compared to CAM2 and T42 CAM3). In contrast to the strong negative response in the shortwave forcing seen in the ERBE observations, the response of the shortwave forcing of clouds in the CAM2 and the T42 CAM3 is weak and even has a sign opposite to observations when it is averaged over the entire region of surface warming. The simulation of the response of the shortwave forcing in the T85 CAM3 is considerably improved, though the negative response over the equatorial Pacific is still not strong enough compared to ERBE observations. The stronger negative response in the shortwave forcing in the T85 CAM3 is apparently linked to a stronger response in the middle level cloud cover. All three models fail to simulate the observed pattern of the response in the low cloud cover over the central and eastern Pacific, resulting in deficiency in the response of the shortwave cloud forcing in that region. The deficiency in the low cloud cover response suggests that the low cloud cover scheme has room for improvement.",

        "abstract": "This study focuses on the analysis of winter (October-November-December-January-\nFebruary-March; ONDJFM) storm events and their changes due to increased anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations over Europe. In order to assess uncertainties that are due to model formulation, 4 regional climate models (RCMs) with 5 high resolution experiments, and 4 global general circulation models (GCMs) are considered. Firstly, cyclone systems as synoptic scale processes in winter are investigated, as they are a principal cause of the occurrence of extreme, damage-causing wind speeds. This is achieved by use of an objective cyclone identification and tracking algorithm applied to GCMs. Secondly, changes in extreme near-surface wind speeds are analysed. Based on\npercentile thresholds, the studied extreme wind speed indices allow a consistent analysis over Europe that takes systematic deviations of the models into account. Relative changes in both intensity and frequency of extreme winds and their related uncertainties are assessed and related to changing patterns of extreme cyclones. A common feature of all investigated GCMs is a reduced track density over central Europe under climate change conditions, if all systems are considered. If only extreme (i.e. the strongest 5%) cyclones are taken into account, an increasing cyclone activity for western parts of central Europe is apparent; however, the climate change signal reveals a reduced spatial coherency when compared to all systems, which exposes partially contrary results. With respect to extreme wind speeds, significant positive changes in intensity and frequency are obtained over at least 3 and 20% of the European domain under study (35\u201372\u00b0 N and 15\u00b0W\u201343\u00b0 E), respectively. \nLocation and extension of the affected areas (up to 60 and 50% of the domain for intensity and frequency, respectively), as well as levels of changes (up to +15 and +200% for intensity and frequency, respectively) are shown to be highly dependent on the driving GCM, whereas differences between RCMs when driven by the same GCM are relatively small.",

        "abstract": "We have analysed a suite of 12 state-of-the-art climate models and show that ocean warming and sea-level rise in the twentieth century were substantially reduced by the colossal eruption in 1883 of the volcano Krakatoa. Volcanically induced cooling of the ocean surface penetrated into deeper layers, where it persisted for decades after the event. This remarkable effect on oceanic thermal structure is longer lasting than has previously been suspected and is sufficient to offset a large fraction of ocean warming and sea-level rise caused by anthropogenic influences.  An oceanic response to the 1991 Pinatubo eruption, which was comparable to Krakatoa in terms of its radiative forcing, has been identified in satellite altimetry data. The simulated heat-content recovery after Pinatubo seems to occur much more rapidly than for Krakatoa. This disparity arises because the Pinatubo response is superimposed on a non-stationary background of large and increasing greenhouse-gas forcing. The heat-content effects of Pinatubo and other eruptions in the late twentieth century are offset by the observed warming of the upper ocean, which is primarily due to anthropogenic influences.\n",

Our primary objective is to evaluate a recent suite of coupled ocean-atmosphere simulations of the twentieth century in the context of available observations. In support of this objective, we extend the analysis and interpretation of observational estimates. In many respects, the collection of models examined compare well with observations. The largest signal in the annual cycle of ocean heat content is in the midlatitudes, where all the models do a credible job of capturing the amplitude, phasing, and depth penetration. Judging the models' performance at high latitudes is more complex because of the sparseness of observations and complications owing to the presence of sea ice.

        "abstract": "A subset of climate simulations of the 20th century from the IPCC-AR4 were analyzed to assess the ability of these models to reproduce the observed climatological seasonal precipitation in South America during the period 1970-1999. In addition, changes of such climatology in a climate change scenario (SRESA1b) over the period 2070-2099 are also discussed. \nResults show that models are able to reproduce the main features of the precipitation seasonal cycle over South America. Although, the precipitation in the SACZ region and the precipitation maximum over southeastern South America observed during the cold season are not well represented. \nThere is a generalized consensus among models that the precipitation changes projected are mainly: i) an increase of summer precipitation over southeastern subtropical South America; ii) a reduction of winter precipitation over most of the continent; and iii) reduction of precipitation during the four seasons along the southern Andes. \n",

        "abstract": "The ability of the climate model simulations performed for the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) in reproducing the leading patterns of atmospheric circulation in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) and their influence on precipitation variability in South America are discussed here, using the same subset of the climate simulations of the 20th century (20c3m) described in Part I. CMAP precipitation dataset and NCEP-NCAR reanalyses were used to describe the observed patterns. The leading patterns of circulation in the SH were identified through an analysis of the Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOFs) for the 500-hPa geopotential height anomalies over the SH, southward of 20\u00b0S.  Regression and correlation maps were computed for observations and model simulations. For those models that an ensemble of runs are available, the maps were first computed per individual run and then averaged over all runs available for each model.\n\nIt was found that all models are able to reproduce a first leading pattern resembling the SAM. On the other hand, just some of them can reproduce PSA-like structure associated with the second and third leading patterns. The analysis suggests that GFDL, GISS and MPI are the models that reproduce patterns more similar to those observed. Regarding the observed relationship between ENSO and SH circulation anomalies and precipitation anomalies in South America, it was found that most of the model second leading patterns are significantly correlated with ENSO. Nevertheless, there is considerable dispersion among models regarding the ENSO amplitude and the SH circulation response to ENSO. It was also found not only for model results but also for NCEP, that both ENSO-related signal and that of SAM were projected onto more than one EOF. This result can be associated with limitations in the EOF technique in separating physical modes and/or sampling errors associated with the length of the period considered. The relationship between monthly mean precipitation anomalies and the three leading patterns of SH circulation variability show that most of the models reproduced the SAM influence onto precipitation variability at the southern Andes. On the other hand, just a few of them were able to reproduce the observed influence of both PSA1 and PSA2 on South American precipitation variability. The last result can be associated with model deficiencies in reproducing the ENSO cycle and its remote influence on the SH circulation variability. \n\n",

Each is also simulating various key aspects of the observed ice cover distributions, such as winter ice not only throughout the central Arctic basin but also throughout Hudson Bay, despite its relatively low latitudes. However, some of the models simulate too much ice, others too little ice (in some cases depending on hemisphere and/or season), and some match the observations better in one season versus another. Several models do noticeably better in the Northern Hemisphere than in the Southern Hemisphere, and one does noticeably better in the Southern Hemisphere. In the Northern Hemisphere all simulate monthly average ice extents to within + 5.1 x 106 km2 of the observed ice extent throughout the year; and in the Southern Hemisphere all except one simulate the monthly averages to within + 6.3 x 106 km2 of the observed values. All the models properly simulate a lack of winter ice to the west of Norway; however, most do not obtain as much absence of ice immediately north of Norway as the observations show, suggesting an under simulation of the North Atlantic Current. The spread in monthly averaged ice extents among the 11 model simulations is greater in the Southern Hemisphere than in the Northern Hemisphere and greatest in the Southern Hemisphere winter and spring",

The climate scenarios are constructed for the target years 2050 and 2100, for both a moderate and a large rise in global mean atmospheric temperature. The climate scenarios contain contributions from changes in ocean density (thermal expansion) and changes in ocean mass (melting of mountain glaciers and ice caps, changes in the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, and terrestrial water-storage contributions). All major components depend on the global temperature rise achieved in the target periods considered. The resulting set of climate scenarios represents our best estimate of twenty-first century sea level rise in the northeast Atlantic Ocean, given the current understanding of the various contributions.  This set meets the requirements of policy-makers and at the same time does justice to scientific uncertainties.",

For current climate conditions, the subtropical part of the meridional mode is reasonably well simulated, in contrast to the deep tropical part of the meridional mode and the zonal mode. A common model bias is that the onset of the meridional mode is preceded by the presence of a zonal mode in boreal fall that extends towards the western boundary of the Atlantic basin and which initiates a Wind-Evaporation-SST (WES) feedback. As a result of this, there is a spuriously strong interaction between the zonal and the meridional mode. The models that best represent the meridional mode show a weakening for future climate conditions. Biases in the zonal mode are too strong to assess changes.",

Using statistical analysis we\nobserve Bjerknes compensation on decadal timescales at latitudes in between\n50N and 80N. A maximum compensation rate of 55% occurs at 70N. At this\nlatitude the correlation rate peaks when the ocean is leading the atmosphere\nby one year. The mechanisms by which Bjerknes compensation occurs at this\nlatitude are investigated. Anomalies in oceanic heat transport appear to be\nassociated with variations in the strength of the Atlantic meridional\noverturning circulation (MOC). The associated sea surface temperature (SST)\nanomalies are in general too weak to assert a significant impact on the\natmosphere. At 60N however, such SST anomalies prelude the transition from\nsea-ice coverage to open water after which the associated changes in heat\nexchange with the atmosphere are strong enough to force an atmospheric\nresponse. Due to the presence of a strong MOC component in the Atlantic ocean,\nthis interaction is confined to the region where the Northeast Atlantic and\nArctic Ocean connect. The atmospheric response to increased (decreased)\nheating from below is a decreased (increased) poleward temperature gradient,\nleading to a decreased (increased) heat transport by baroclinic eddies.\nThe direct impact of MOC-variations on sea-ice coverage in the Labrador Sea\nis too weak to induce an atmospheric response there, which initially stays\nconfined to the Northeast Atlantic. The anomalous thermal low (high) that is\nset-up by heating (cooling) from the ocean is associated with anomalous\nadvection of cold air from the Greenland land-mass, which eventually may\ntrigger(halt) the intermittent convection in the Irminger Sea. The associated\nSST-anomalies are quickly advected by the Greenland Current into the Labrador\nSea where they have a similar impact on sea-ice coverage as the more direct\nresponse of the Northeast Atlantic.",

        "abstract": "A suite of climate model experiments indicates that 20th Century increases in ocean heat content and sea-level (via thermal expansion) were substantially reduced by the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa. The volcanically-induced cooling of the ocean surface is subducted into deeper ocean layers, where it persists for decades. Temporary reductions in ocean heat content associated with the comparable eruptions of El Chich\u00f3n (1982) and Pinatubo (1991) were much shorter lived because they occurred relative to a non-stationary background of large, anthropogenically-forced ocean warming. Our results suggest that inclusion of the effects of Krakatoa (and perhaps even earlier eruptions) is important for reliable simulation of 20th century ocean heat uptake and thermal expansion. Inter-model differences in the oceanic thermal response to Krakatoa are large and arise from differences in external forcing, model physics, and experimental design. Systematic experimentation is required to quantify the relative importance of these factors. The next generation of historical forcing experiments may require more careful treatment of pre-industrial volcanic aerosol loadings. \n\n",

        "abstract": "\u201cGreat Salinity Anomalies\u201d (GSAs) have been observed to propagate in the upper ocean around the sub-polar gyre of the North Atlantic with a decadal time-scale of both propagation and return. Successful simulation of such features in the ocean is an important prerequisite for confidence in predictions of the ocean\u2019s response to future freshwater anomalies from ice melt or sub-polar river discharge. The coupled climate model experiments prepared for the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change offer a unique cross-section of model formulations, resolutions and scenarios with which to explore climate models\u2019 ability to produce GSAs. The performance of nine different models, with a range of horizontal and vertical atmospheric and oceanic resolutions, in producing GSAs was examined using a base period of 100 years. One scenario was a pre-industrial control simulation, while the other was forced by an increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide of an enhanced greenhouse world (scenario sresa1b). It was found that the strongest control on the existence of model GSAs was the oceanic horizontal resolution. This needed to be of the order of 1.5o or less for GSAs to occur within the model. In those models which possessed GSAs these were overwhelmingly generated within the Labrador Sea, with similar periodicities to those observed. Anomalies reaching the Greenland Sea through the Nordic Sea gyre circulations generally slowed and died before propagating back into the Atlantic. Freshwater flow through the Canadian Archipelago appears to be an important factor in producing the most realistic simulation. Within the greenhouse world GSAs were significantly less likely to occur, were weaker and more likely to originate from east of Greenland. ",

        "abstract": "The surface albedos simulated by seventeen climate models over the northern latitudes of the Western Hemisphere were compared with satellite-derived albedo products provided by the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP). Model simulations were conducted in support of the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). Results show the following: (1) Annual albedo of the region averaged for all models is fairly close to that provided by the ISCCP (0.351 versus 0.334). The difference between model average and ISCCP albedos is well below the standard deviation in albedo among models. (2) Most models simulated seasonal variations in regional albedo reasonably well. In summer, the models systematically overestimated albedo relative to the ISCCP data by as much as 0.05. In winter, large differences were detected among the climate models. (3) The spatial correlations among models, and between models and ISCCP, depend on geographic location, season and surface type. In general, the spatial correlation coefficients between individual models and the ISCCP data were highest for the land surface in midsummer and for the ocean surface in spring. Model bias was smaller for the ocean surface than for the land surface, and smaller in summer than in winter. (4) Unlike the modeling results, the satellite data showed large interannual variations in albedo and a systematic decreasing trend over the 16 year period of 1984\u20131999. Depending on season, the standard deviation of albedo interannual variation ranged from 0.036 to 0.074, and the linear regression slope of the decreasing trend ranged from -0.02 to -0.05 per decade according to ISCCP results. The large interannual variation and decreasing trend are not reflected in model simulations. Additional efforts are still required to improve surface albedo simulations in GCMs and its mapping from satellite",

        "abstract": "The identification of clear-sky and cloudy pixels is a key step in the processing of satellite observations. This is equally important for surface and cloud-atmosphere applications. In this paper, we present the SPARC (Separation of Pixels using Aggregated Rating over Canada) algorithm, a new method of pixel identification for image data from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) onboard the NOAA satellites. The SPARC algorithm separates image pixels into clear-sky and cloudy categories based on a specially designed rating scheme. A mask depicting snow/ice and cloud shadows is also generated. The SPARC algorithm has been designed to work year round (day and night) over the temperate and polar regions of North America, for current and historical AVHRR/NOAA High-Resolution Picture Transmission (HRPT) and Local Area Coverage (LAC) data with original 1-km spatial resolution. The algorithm was tested and applied to data from the AVHRR sensors flown onboard NOAA-6 to NOAA-18. The method was employed in generating historical clear-sky composites for the 1982-2005 period at daily, 10-day and monthly time-scales at 1-km resolution for an area of 5700\u00d74800 km2 centered over Canada. This region also covers the northern part of the United States including Alaska, as well as Greenland and the surrounding oceans.\nThe SPARC algorithm is designed to produce an aggregated rating that accumulates the results of several tests. The magnitude of the rating serves as an indicator of the probability for a pixel to belong to clear-sky, partly cloudy or overcast categories. The individual tests employ the spectral properties of 5 AVHRR channels, as well as surface the skin temperature maps from the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) dataset. These temperature fields are available at 32\u00d732 km2 spatial resolution and at 3 hour time intervals. Combining all test results into one final rating for each pixel is beneficial for the generation of multi-scene clear-sky composites. The selection of the best pixel to be used in the final clear-sky product is based on the magnitude of the rating. This provides much improved results relative to other approaches or \u201cyes/no\u201d decision methods.\nThe SPARC method has been compared to the results of supervised classification for a number of AVHRR scenes representing various seasons (snow-free summer, winter with snow/ice coverage and transition seasons). The results show an overall agreement between the automated (SPARC) and the supervised classification at the level of 80 % to 91 %.",

        "title": "Another Look at Monsoon Annual Variability and Its Application to Evaluate Monsoon Simulation in AMIP Models. Part II: Wind Onset and Withdrawal of Monsoons",
        "abstract": "This study defines the concepts of wind onset and wind withdrawal to describe the abrupt variations of wind direction and circulation of the Asian monsoon. The patterns of wind onset and withdrawal show that the earliest wind onset in monsoon regions is found over equator around 70\u00b0-100\u00b0E, the wind retreat contrast to the wind onset shown a southward progression in tropics. In addition, a notable temporal boundary is found around 25\u00b0N in the subtropical western North Pacific, which may be related to the northward advance and southward retreat of the western Pacific subtropical high. The rotational amplitudes of wind vector in wind onset and withdrawal have regional differences in Asian monsoon regions. Since the process of monsoon onset (withdrawal) may include abruptions of several variables without simultaneity, the relationships of the dates of onset and withdrawal with the abrupt time of other variables (e.g. reversal of zonal wind, OLR, precipitation) are investigated. The results indicate the temporal differences in different monsoon regions confirmed the asynchronous abruption. It also implies that the wind onset might be a good omen for monsoon precipitation in some regions since it is slightly earlier than rainy season onset. Seven model results from AMIP AR4 are validated against observations mentioned above. On the whole, most models appear to more correctly reproduce the broad features of the wind withdrawal than those of the wind onset. For wind onset, IAP-FGOALS-1.0g, MIROC3.2 (medres) and MPI-ECHAM5 simulate reasonably well. For wind retreats, most models can capture the behaviors in tropics. However, there are still notable shortcomings in some models to simulate this transitional characteristic of wind direction in monsoon onset and withdrawal which need further improvement.",

        "title": "Another Look at Monsoon Annual Variability and Its Application to Evaluate Monsoon Simulation in AMIP Models. Part I: Wind Vector Rotational Regimes",
        "abstract": "Based on the seasonal reversal of wind vector which is the essential characteristic of monsoon, a new concept, the directed angle, is introduced to study rotational regimes of global wind vector and monsoon annul variability. Compared with the previous studies using angle between wind vectors, this concept better reflects the daily variations of wind direction including the rotational direction and amplitude. According to the concept, six categories of wind vector rotation with seasonal cycle have been detected and classified as follows: (I) Clockwise to counter-clockwise rotation; (II) Counter-clockwise to clockwise rotation; (III) Full clockwise rotation; (IV) Full counter-clockwise rotation; (V) Stable style; (VI) Instable style. In monsoon regions, the wind generally rotates in the forms of the first four categories with seasonal evolution. The global distribution pattern of wind vector rotation regime shows that different rotational styles of wind vector are closely related to seasonal evolution of atmospheric circulation systems, including the strength and movement of trough and ridge, the development, movement and split of anticyclone or cyclone, as well as the seasonal variation of solar radiation. Moreover, different monsoon systems possess different wind vector rotational styles with seasonal evolution, for instance, the South Asian monsoon is the style II while the East Asian monsoon is the style IV, the style I is showed in the South China Sea, and the style III in the South Indo-China Peninsula and the West Africa. In addition, this study\nemployed this new concept to evaluate the model outputs of 8 AGCMs of AMIP in\nIPCC 4th assessment. The results show that this application not only reflects the dynamic process and global distribution of wind vector rotational styles in monsoon simulation, but also embodies the abilities for AGCMs to reproducing circulation seasonal variations. In general, most models show the global distribution pattern reasonable well compared to the corresponding observations, but so little skill is shown in the monsoon rotational styles of some models, especially in South China Sea and West Africa. Moreover, the simulations differ mostly from observations during the transitional season.",

        "title": "Evaluation of IPCC AR4 Soil Moisture Simulations for the Second Half of the Twentieth Century",
        "abstract": "Soil moisture trends, particularly during the growing season, are an important possible consequence of global warming.  Climate model simulations of future soil moisture changes should be made with models that can produce reliable simulations of soil moisture for past climate changes.  In this paper, we compare soil moisture simulations from Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment climate models forced with observed climate forcings for the past century, and evaluate them using in situ soil moisture measurements from over 140 stations or districts in mid-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere.  To account for the observed spatial scale of soil moisture variations, we used regionally-averaged soil moisture for six regions.  The models showed realistic seasonal cycles for Ukraine, Russia, and Illinois, but generally poor seasonal cycles for Mongolia and China.  \n\tTo explore the summer drying issue for the second half of the 20th century, we analyzed the linear trend of soil moisture for Ukraine and Russia.  Observations from both regions show increases in summer for the period from 1958-1999 that were larger than most trends in the model simulations.  Only two out of 25 model realizations show trends comparable to those of observations.  These two trends, however, are due to internal model variability rather than a result of external forcing.  Changes in precipitation and temperature cannot fully explain soil moisture increases for Ukraine and Russia, which indicates that other factors might have played a dominant role on the observed patterns for soil moisture.  We suggest that changes in solar irradiance (the dimming effect) and resultant changes in evaporative demand explain most of the observed soil moisture trends.  To understand such sensitivity, we analyzed soil moisture outputs in a special version of the ECHAM5 model that was capable of capturing the observed radiation pattern as a result of incorporating a sophisticated aerosol scheme.  Results suggest that both radiation and precipitation patterns are required to be adequately simulated to reproduce the observed soil moisture trends realistically. \n",

        "abstract": "Distribution changes in seasonal mean 2m temperature are investigated in Central Europe and the extratropical northern Hemisphere for the most recent period 1961-2005 and the 21st century. Data from both observations and climate model runs are used. The latter are taken from scenarios prepared for the fourth IPCC assessment report (AR4). All data sets and model runs are scaled by their corresponding interannual variability to facilitate the comparison between the datasets. Time series are detrended to investigate changes in internal variability. For the last 45 years (1961-2005) the strongest changes in mean are found for in the summer mean temperature, both in observations and AR4 runs. With the exception of autumn, changes in the mean are captured reasonably well by the models on the regional as well as hemispheric scale. For Central Europe, estimates for variability changes show a weak increase (decrease) in summer (winter) observations. Both are not statistically significant at the 10% level. For the 21st century all climate scenario runs suggest large relative increases in mean temperature for all seasons. The AR4 model-to-model differences in the mean changes are largest in summer and not substantially smaller than those from the third assessment report (TAR). Model uncertainties are in the same order or even larger than the uncertainty introduced by the different scenarios. Compared to TAR, the AR4 runs show a much more consistent tendency for increases in Central Europe summer temperature variability especially towards the end of the 21st century (for 2070-2099: ~22% to 47% increase). No clear changes in seasonal mean temperature variability are found for the other seasons and the averaged Northern Hemisphere land time series.",

        "abstract": "This study evaluates the fidelity of North American monsoon and associated intraseasonal variability in IPCC AR4 (the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report) coupled general circulation models (GCMs). Twenty years of monthly precipitation from each of the 22 models\u2019 20th century climate simulation, together with the available daily precipitation from 14 of them, are analyzed and compared with GPCP monthly and daily precipitation. We focus on the seasonal cycle and horizontal pattern of monsoon precipitation, together with the two dominant intraseasonal modes: the eastward-propagating Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) and the westward-propagating easterly waves.\n\nThe results show that current state-of-the-art GCMs have significant problems and display a wide range of skill in simulating the North American monsoon and associated intraseasonal variability. Most of the models reproduce the monsoon rain belt extending from southeast to northwest. However, most models overestimate the precipitation over the core monsoon region throughout the seasonal cycle. Although many models reproduce the gradual northward shift of precipitation from March to July, several models simulate a nearly simultaneous increase of precipitation in northern and southern latitudes, leading to a too-early monsoon onset. Moreover, most models fail to reproduce the gradual southward shift of precipitation from August to November, and keep the high precipitation in monsoon region until the end of the year.\n\nRegarding the intraseasonal modes, most of the models produce overly weak variances for both the MJO and easterly waves, and simulate poor eastward propagation of the MJO. Nevertheless, most models simulate good westward propagation of easterly waves.\n",

        "title": "Intraseasonal Variability Associated with Asian Summer Monsoon Simulated by 14 IPCC AR4 Coupled GCMs",
        "abstract": "This study evaluates the intraseasonal variability associated with the Asian summer monsoon in 14 coupled general circulation models (GCMs) participating in the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4).  Eight years of daily precipitation from each model\u2019s 20th century climate simulation are analyzed and compared with daily satellite retrieved precipitation. We focus on the three major components of Asian summer monsoon: the Indian summer monsoon (ISM), the western North Pacific summer monsoon (WNPSM), and the east Asian summer monsoon (EASM), together with the two dominant intraseasonal modes: the eastward and northward propagating boreal summer intraseasonal oscillation (BSIO) and the westward propagating 12-24 day mode.\n\nThe results show that current state-of-the-art GCMs display a wide range of skill in simulating the intraseasonal variability associated with Asian summer monsoon. During boreal summer (May-October), most of the models produce reasonable seasonal mean precipitation over the ISM region, but excessive precipitation over WNPSM region and insufficient precipitation over EASM region. In other words, models concentrate their rain too close to the equator in the Western Pacific. Most of the models simulate overly weak total intraseasonal (2-128 day) variance, as well as too little variance for BSIO and the 12-24 day mode. Moreover, models often have difficulty in simulating the eastward propagation of BSIO. Nevertheless, many models simulate well the northward propagation of BSIO, together with the westward propagation of the 12-24 day mode. The northward propagation in these models is thus not simply a NW-SE tilted tail protruding off of an eastward-moving deep-tropical intraseasonal oscillation. Only 4-5 models produce spectral peaks in the BSIO and 12-24 day frequency bands; instead, most of the models display too red a spectrum, i.e. an overly strong persistence of precipitation.\n",

The results show that the state-of-the-art CGCMs display a wide range of skill in simulating the interdecadal variability of ENSO. The 22 models can be categorized into three groups. The first group (8 models) shows an oscillation with a constant period shorter than the observed ENSO period, and sometimes with a constant amplitude. The second group (6 models) does not produce many statistically significant peaks in the ENSO frequency band, but usually produces one or two prominent peaks (episodes) at period longer than 6 years. The third group (8 models) displays significant interdecadal variability of ENSO in both amplitude and period.

        "abstract": "This study examines the double-ITCZ (Intertropical Convergence Zone) problem in the coupled general circulation models (CGCMs) participating in the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4).  The 20th century climate simulations of 22 IPCC AR4 CGCMs are analyzed, together with the available AMIP runs from 12 of them. To understand the physical mechanisms for the double-ITCZ problem, the main ocean-atmosphere feedbacks, including the zonal sea surface temperature (SST) gradient&#8722;trade wind feedback (or Bjerknes feedback), the SST&#8722;surface latent heat flux (LHF) feedback, and the SST&#8722;surface shortwave flux (SWF) feedback, are studied in detail. \n\nThe results show that most of the current state-of-the-art CGCMs have some degree of the double-ITCZ problem, which is characterized by excessive precipitation over much of the tropics (e.g. northern hemisphere ITCZ, South Pacific Convergence Zone, maritime continent, and equatorial Indian Ocean), and often associated with insufficient precipitation over equatorial Pacific. The excessive precipitation over much of the tropics usually causes overly strong trade winds, excessive LHF and insufficient SWF, leading to significant cold SST bias in much of the tropical oceans. Most of the models also simulate insufficient latitudinal asymmetry in precipitation and SST over eastern Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.\n\nThe AMIP runs also produce excessive precipitation over much of the tropics including equatorial Pacific, which also leads to overly strong trade winds, excessive LHF and insufficient SWF. This suggests that the excessive tropical precipitation is an intrinsic error of the atmospheric models, and that the insufficient equatorial Pacific precipitation in the coupled runs of many models comes from ocean-atmosphere feedback. Feedback analysis demonstrates that the insufficient equatorial Pacific precipitation in different models is associated with one or more of the following three biases in ocean-atmosphere feedback over equatorial Pacific: (1) excessive Bjerknes feedback, which is caused by excessive sensitivity of precipitation to SST and overly strong time-mean surface wind speed; (2) overly positive SST-LHF feedback, which is caused by excessive sensitivity of surface air humidity to SST; and (3) insufficient SST-SWF feedback, which is caused by insufficient sensitivity of cloud amount to precipitation. Off the equator over the eastern Pacific stratus region, most of the models produce insufficient stratus-SST feedback associated with insufficient sensitivity of stratus cloud amount to SST, which may contribute to the insufficient latitudinal asymmetry of SST in their coupled runs. These results suggest that the double-ITCZ problem in CGCMs may be alleviated by reducing the excessive tropical precipitation and the above feedback-relevant errors in the atmospheric models.\n",

Associated with this widening is a concomitant poleward expansion of the subtropical dry zone. Simple scaling analysis supports the notion that the poleward extent of the Hadley cell is set by the location where the thermally driven jet first becomes baroclinically unstable. The expansion of the Hadley cell is caused by an increase in the subtropical static stability, which pushes poleward the baroclinic instability zone and hence the outer boundary of the Hadley cell.",

        "abstract": "Four climate system models are chosen here for an analysis of ENSO amplitude changes in 4xCO2 climate change projections. Despite the large changes in the tropical Pacific mean state, the changes in ENSO amplitude are highly model dependant. In order to investigate why similar mean state changes lead to very different ENSO amplitude changes, we analyze the characteristics of sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA) variability simulated in two coupled general circulation models (CGCMs): the Meteorological Research Institute (MRI) and Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) models. The skewed distribution of tropical Pacific SSTA simulated in the MRI model suggests the importance of non-linearities in the ENSO physics, whereas the GFDL model lies in the linear regime. Consistent with these differences in ENSO regime, the GFDL is insensitive to the mean state changes, whereas the MRI model is sensitive to the mean state changes associated with the 4xCO2 scenario. Similarly, the low frequency modulation of ENSO amplitude in the GFDL model is related to atmospheric stochastic forcing, but in the MRI model the amplitude modulation is insensitive to the noise forcing. These results suggest that the understanding of changes in ENSO statistics among various climate change projections is highly dependent on whether the model ENSO is in the linear or non-linear regime.",

        "abstract": "Temperature and precipitation extremes and their potential future\nchanges are evaluated in an ensemble of global coupled climate models\nparticipating in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)\ndiagnostic exercise for the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). Climate\nextremes are expressed in terms of 20-yr return values of annual\nextremes of near-surface temperature and 24-h precipitation\namounts. The simulated changes in extremes are documented for years\n2046-65 and 2081-2100 relative to 1981-2000 in experiments with the\nSpecial Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) B1, A1B, and A2 emission\nscenarios. Overall, the climate models simulate present-day warm\nextremes reasonably well on the global scale, as compared to estimates\nfrom reanalyses. The model discrepancies in simulating cold extremes\nare generally larger than those for warm extremes, especially in sea\nice-covered areas. Simulated present-day precipitation extremes are\nplausible in the extratropics, but uncertainties in extreme\nprecipitation in the Tropics are very large, both in the models and\nthe available observationally based datasets. Changes in warm extremes\ngenerally follow changes in the mean summertime temperature. Cold\nextremes warm faster than warm extremes by about 30%-40%, globally\naveraged. The excessive warming of cold extremes is generally confined\nto regions where snow and sea ice retreat with global warming. With\nthe exception of northern polar latitudes, relative changes in the\nintensity of precipitation extremes generally exceed relative changes\nin annual mean precipitation, particularly in tropical and subtropical\nregions. Consistent with the increased intensity of precipitation\nextremes, waiting times for late-twentieth-century extreme\nprecipitation events are reduced almost everywhere, with the exception\nof a few subtropical regions. The multimodel multiscenario consensus\non the projected change in the globally averaged 20-yr return values\nof annual extremes of 24-h precipitation amounts is that there will be\nan increase of about 6% with each kelvin of global warming, with the\nbulk of models simulating values in the range of 4%-10% K 1.

The strength of the atmospheric overturning circulation decreases as the climate warms inall IPCC-AR4 models, in a manner consistent with the thermodynamic scaling arguments of Held and Soden (2006). The weakening occurs preferentially in the zonally-asymmetric (i.e., Walker) rather than zonal-mean (i.e., Hadley) component of the tropical circulation and is shown to induce substantial changes to the thermal structure and circulation of the tropical oceans. Evidence suggests that the overall circulation weakens by decreasing the frequency of strong updrafts and increasing the frequency of weak updrafts; although the robustness of this behavior across all models cannot be confirmed due to lack of data. As the climate warms, changes in both the atmospheric and ocean circulation over the tropical Pacific Ocean resemble \u201cEl Nin&#771;o-like\u201d conditions; however, the mechanisms are shown to be distinct from those of El Nin&#771;o and are reproduced in both mixed-layer and full ocean dynamics coupled climate models. The character of the Indian Ocean response to global warming resembles that of Indian Ocean Dipole Mode events. The consensus of model results presented here are also consistent with recently-detected changes in sea level pressure since the mid-19thCentury.",

This study focuses on vertical wind shear(Vs)over the tropical Atlantic during hurricane season, the increase of which has been historically associated with diminished hurricane activity and intensity. A suite of state-of-the-art global climate model experiments is used to project changes in Vs over the 21st century. Substantial (up to 30%)increases in tropical Atlantic and East Pacific shear are robust features of these experiments, and are shown to be connected to the model-projected decrease in the Pacific Walker circulation. The relative changes in shear are found to be comparable to those of other large-scale environmental parameters associated with Atlantic hurricane activity.

The dry static stability within the midlatitudes exhibits a robust increase in the simulations, with upper tropospheric warming outpacing the lower troposphere by approximately 2 K.  The increase in stability is especially evident in the summer season, and is more prominent in the Southern Hemisphere than in the Northern.  The moist static stability is largely unchanged, on the other hand, showing that moist convection plays a dominant role in determining the temperature structure of the midlatitudes.  We compare bulk measures of the stability with changes in meridional gradients for each individual model simulation, and find that moist theories work well in predicting the stability with the primary exception of the Northern Hemisphere summer, where enhanced surface warming over land reduces the increase in stability.\n",

        "abstract": "Using the set of simulations performed with atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs) for the Fourth Assessment Report of the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC AR4), the projected regional distribution of sea ice for the 21st century has been investigated.  Averaged over all those model simulations, the current climate is reasonably well reproduced.  However, this averaging procedure hides the errors from individual models.  Over the 20th century, the multimodel average simulates a larger sea-ice concentration decrease around the Antarctic Peninsula compared to other regions, which is in qualitative agreement with observations.  This is likely related to the positive trend in the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) index over the 20th century, in both observations and in the multimodel average.  Despite the simulated positive future trend in SAM, such a regional feature around the Antarctic Peninsula is absent in the projected sea-ice change for the end of the 21st century.  The maximum decrease is indeed located over the central Weddell Sea and the Amundsen-Bellingshausen Seas.  In most models, changes in the oceanic currents could play a role in the regional distribution of the sea ice, especially in the Ross Sea, where stronger southward currents could also be responsible for a smaller sea-ice decrease during the 21st century.  Finally, changes in the mixed layer depth can be found in some models, inducing locally strong changes in the sea-ice concentration. ",

The comparison is performed in the tropics by sorting the FTH in dynamical regimes defined upon the 500hPa vertical velocity. Because microwave radiation penetrates non-rainy and warm clouds, we are able to estimate the FTH over most of the dynamical regimes that characterize the tropics. The comparisons reveal that two models simulate a free troposphere drier than observed (< 10%), while the others agree with the observations. Despite some differences, the level of agreement is good enough to lend confidence in the representation of atmospheric\nmoistening processes.

        "title": "The role of northern sea ice cover for the weakening of the thermohaline circulation under global warming",
        "abstract": "An increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration and the resulting global warming are typically associated with a weakening of the thermohaline circulation (THC) in model scenarios. For the models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP), this weakening shows a significant (r=0.62) dependence on the initial THC strength: it is stronger for initially strong overturning. We propose a physical mechanism for this phenomenon based on an analysis of additional simulations with the coupled climate models CLIMBER-2 and CLIMBER-3\u000b. The mechanism is based on the fact that sea ice cover greatly reduces heat loss from the ocean. The extent of sea ice is strongly influenced by the near surface atmospheric temperature (SAT) in the North Atlantic but also by the strength of the THC itself which transports heat to the convection sites. Consequently, sea ice tends to extend further south for weaker THC. Initially larger sea-ice cover responds more strongly to atmospheric warming, thus sea ice retreats more strongly for an initially weaker THC. This sea ice retreat tends to strengthen, i.e. stabilize, the THC because the sea ice retreat allows more oceanic heat loss. This stabilizing effect is stronger for runs with weak initial THC and extensive sea ice cover. Therefore an initially weak THC weakens less under global warming. In contrast to pre-industrial climate, sea ice melting presently plays the role of an external forcing with respect to THC stability.",

        "abstract": "Solar fluxes at the Earth\u2019s surface calculated in General Circulation Models (GCMs)\ncontain large uncertainties, not only in the presence of clouds but, as shown here, even\nunder clear-sky (i.e., cloud-free) conditions. Adequate observations to constrain the\nuncertainties in these clear-sky fluxes have long been missing. The present study provides\nnewly derived observational clear-sky climatologies at worldwide distributed anchor\nsites with high-accuracy measurements from the Baseline Surface Radiation Network\n(BSRN) and the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program (ARM). These data are\nused to systematically assess the performance of a total of 36 GCMs with respect to their\nsurface solar clear-sky fluxes. These models represent almost 2 decades of model\ndevelopment, from the atmospheric model intercomparison projects AMIP I and AMIP II\nto the state of the art models participating in the 4th Assessment Report of the\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC-AR4). Results show that earlier model\nversions tend to largely overestimate the surface insolation under cloud-free conditions.\nThis identifies an overly transparent cloud-free atmosphere as a key error source for the\nexcessive surface insolation in GCMs noted in previous studies. Possible origins are an\nunderestimated water vapor absorption and a lack of adequate aerosol forcing.\nSimilar biases remain in a number of current models with comparatively low atmospheric\nclear-sky solar absorption (around 60 Wm-2 in the global mean). However, there are\nnow several models participating in IPCC-AR4 with higher atmospheric clear-sky\nabsorption (70 Wm-2 and up, globally averaged) and more realistic aerosol treatment,\nwhich are in excellent agreement with the newly derived observational clear-sky\nclimatologies. This underlines the progress made in radiative transfer modeling as well as\nin the observation and diagnosis of solar radiation under cloudless atmospheres and puts\nthe most likely value of solar radiation absorbed in the cloud-free atmosphere slightly\nabove 70 Wm-2.",

        "abstract": "How much can we trust model-based projections of future anthropogenic climate change? This review attempts to give an overview of this important but difficult topic by using three main lines of evidence: the skill of models in simulating present-day climate, intermodel agreement on future climate changes, and the ability of models to simulate climate changes that have already occurred. A comparison of simulated and observed present-day climates shows good agreement for many basic variables, particularly at large horizontal scales, and a tendency for biases to vary in sign between different models, but there is a risk that these features might be partly a result of tuning. Overall, the connection between model skill in simulating present-day climate and the skill in simulating future climate changes is poorly known. An intercomparison of future climate changes between models shows a better agreement for changes in temperature than precipitation and sea level pressure, but some aspects of change in the latter two variables are also quite consistent between models. A comparison of simulations with observed climate changes is, in principle, a good test for the models, but there are several complications. Nonetheless, models have skilfully simulated many large-scale aspects of observed climate changes, including but not limited to the evolution of the global mean surface air temperature in the 20th century. Furthermore, although there is no detailed agreement between the simulated and observed geographical patterns of change, the grid box scale temperature, precipitation and pressure changes observed during the past half-century generally fall within the range of model results. Considering the difficulties associated with other sources of information, the variation of climate changes between different models is probably the most meaningful measure of uncertainty that is presently available. In general, however, this measure is more likely to underestimate than overestimate the actual uncertainty.",

        "abstract": "The authors of this study recently proposed a resampling method for deriving probabilistic forecasts of near-term climate change and presented some results focusing on temperature and precipitation changes in southern Finland from 1971-2000 to 2011-2020. Here, the sensitivity of the resulting forecasts to two details of the methodology is studied. First, to account for differences between simulated and observed climate variability, a variance correction technique is devised. Second, the sensitivity of the forecasts to the choice of the baseline period is studied. In southern Finland, the variance correction technique generally widens the derived probability distributions of precipitation change, mirroring an underestimate of the observed precipitation variability in climate models. However, the impact on the derived probability distributions of temperature change is small. The choice of the baseline period is generally more important, but again the forecasts of temperature change are less sensitive to different options than those of precipitation change. Cross-verification suggests that the variance correction leads to a slight improvement in the potential quality of the probabilistic forecasts, especially for precipitation change. The optimal baseline length appears to be at least 30 years, and the baseline should be as late as possible (e.g., 1971-2000 is preferable over 1961-1990).",

The enhanced warming over land is not simply a transient effect, since it is also present in equilibrium conditions. We examine 20 models from the IPCC AR4 database. The global land/sea warming ratio varies in the range 1.36\u20131.84, independent of global mean temperature change. In the presence of increasing radiative forcing, the warming ratio for a single model is fairly constant in time, implying that the land/sea temperature difference increases with time. The warming ratio varies with latitude, with a minimum in equatorial latitudes, and maxima in the subtropics. A simple explanation for these findings is provided, and comparisons are made with observations. For the low-latitude (40\u00b0S\u201340\u00b0N) mean, the models suggest a warming ratio of 1.51 \u00b1 0.13, while recent observations suggest a ratio of 1.54 \u00b1 0.09.",

        "title": "Testing climate models using GPS radio occultation: A sensitivity analysis",
        "abstract": "We survey the IPCC AR4 models' responses to SRES A1B forcing in order to evaluate a prediction of climate change common to all models and testable using GPS radio occultation data over the coming decades. Of the IPCC AR4 models that submitted runs of the SRES A1B forcing scenario, we select twelve because of the timeliness of their submission. Trends in the global average surface air temperature show better overall agreement over the first 50 years than in the IPCC Third Assessment Report, but the patterns of global surface air temperature trends show little improvement in intermodel agreement. These same twelve models show qualitatively better agreement in their patterns of upper air temperature trends. All show maintenance of a moist adiabatic temperature profile in the tropics, making tropospheric temperature trends the greatest at 200 hPa in the tropics. We test the climate models' predictions using optimal fingerprinting. In order to do so, we use long preindustrial control runs of four of the IPCC AR4 models. Simulating trends in the log of the vertically integrated microwave refractivity, or ``dry'' pressure, of the atmosphere is nearly the same as measuring trends in geopotential heights of constant pressure surfaces. The first four EOFs of interannual variability of log-dry pressure, as determined by two independent climate models, are ENSO, modes closely associated with the southern and northern annular modes, and a previously unidentified symmetric jet migration EOF. The latter is characterized by poleward migration of the eddy-driven midlatitude jet correlated between hemispheres. The ENSO mode and especially the symmetric jet migration EOF contribute most to optimal detection and are similarly predicted by the IPCC AR4 models. The common prediction of all climate models will be tested with 95% confidence with GPS radio occultation data in 7 to 13 years. The fingerprint is dominated by symmetric poleward migration of the eddy-driven midlatitude jets.",

        "abstract": "A modification to the traditional cloud radiative forcing (CRF) formula is presented.  This alternative approach uses incident--rather than absorbed--solar radiation to calculate shortwave cloud radiative forcing at the surface.  By removing the competing influence of surface albedo on CRF, the new formula more effectively isolates the impact of clouds and cloud changes under different climatic regimes. The removal of surface albedo effects makes the change in CRF a more useful measure of cloud feedback, although other factors (such as changes in clear-sky solar absorption) can still muddle the interpretation.  I present examples from GCM greenhouse simulations that demonstrate how this new formula can help to differentiate between actual cloud feedbacks versus apparent ones induced by snow and ice meltback using the traditional CRF equation.  The results suggest that changes in surface albedo contribute approximately 20 to 40% of the high-latitude CRF anomaly using the standard formula applied to an equilibrium 2 x CO2 simulation and about 50% to the greater Arctic when used on 21st-century transient greenhouse experiments.",

        "abstract": "Carbon (C) in tropical peatlands over Southeast Asia and Amazonia, if released to the atmosphere, can substantially increase the growth rate of atmospheric carbon dioxide.  Over Southeast Asia, where the most extensive tropical peatlands in the world occur, 11 climate models for the IPCC Fourth Assessment show an overall decrease of rainfall in future dry seasons.  Over Amazonia, future rainfall changes in dry seasons are highly uncertain; five models predict increased rainfall, and the remaining models predict the opposite.  We have further examined the UKMO-HadCM3, GISS-ER, and GFDL-CM2.1 models. Over Southeast Asia, all three models predict similar decreases of rainfall and evaporative fraction, implying an increase of water table depth and surface dryness during the dry season south of the equator.  Such changes would potentially switch peat ecosystems from acting as C sinks to C sources.  Over Amazonia, the two models with the best simulations of current rainfall produce conflicting results for the future of peat stability.",

Although the models examined here are able to simulate the land precipitation amount well, most of them are unable to reproduce the spatial patterns of the precipitation frequency and intensity. For light precipitation (1\u201310 mm day&#8722;1), most models overestimate the frequency but produce patterns of the intensity that are in broad agreement with observations. In contrast, for heavy precipitation (>10 mm day&#8722;1), most models considerably underestimate the intensity but simulate the frequency relatively well. The average number of rainy days contributing to most of the annual precipitation is a simple index that captures the combined effects of precipitation frequency and intensity on the water supply. The different measures of precipitation characteristics examined in this paper reveal region-to-region differences in the observations and models of relevance for climate variability, water resources, and climate change.",

        "abstract": "Daily precipitation data from climate change simulations using the latest generation of coupled climate system models are analyzed for potential future changes in precipitation characteristics.  For the emission scenarios SRES B1 (a low projection), A1B (a medium projection), and A2 (a high projection) during the 21st century, all the models consistently show a shift towards more intense and extreme precipitation for the globe as a whole and over various regions. For both SRES B1 and A2, most models show decreased daily precipitation frequency and all the models show increased daily precipitation intensity. The multi-model averaged percentage increase in the precipitation intensity (2.0% K-1) is larger than the magnitude of the precipitation frequency decrease (-0.7% K-1).  However, the shift in precipitation frequency distribution towards extremes results in large increases in very heavy precipitation events (>50 mm day-1), so that for very heavy precipitation, the percentage increase in frequency is much larger than the increase in intensity (31.2% vs. 2.4%). The climate model-projected increases in daily precipitation intensity are, however, smaller than that based on simple thermodynamics (~7% K-1). Multi-model ensemble means show that precipitation amount increases during the 21st century over high latitudes, as well as over currently wet regions in low- and mid-latitudes more than other regions. This increase mostly results from a combination of increased frequency and intensity. Over the dry regions in the subtropics, precipitation amount generally declines because of decreases in both frequency and intensity. This indicates that wet regions may get wetter and dry regions may become drier mostly because of simultaneous increase (decrease) of precipitation frequency and intensity.",

For all energy budget components in the twentieth-century simulations (the 20C3M simulation), the across-model variance and the differences from observational estimates are largest in the marginal ice zone (Barents, Kara, Chukchi Seas). Both downward and upward longwave radiation at the surface are underestimated in winter by many models, and the ensenmble mean annual net surface energy loss by longwave radiation is 35 W/m2, which is less than for the NCEP and ERA40 reanalyses but in line with some of the satellite estimates. \nIncoming solar radiation is overestimated by the models in spring and underestimated in summer and autumn. \nThe ensemble mean annual net surface energy gain by shortwave radiation is 39 W/m2, which is slightly less than for the observational based estimates, In the twentyfirst-century simulations driven by the SRES A2 scenario, increased concentrations of greenhouse gasses increase (average for 2080\u20132100 minus average for 1980\u20132000 averages) the annual average ensemble mean downward longwave radiation by 30.1 W/m2. This was partly counteracted by a 10.7 W/m2 reduction in downward shortwave radiation. \nEnhanced sea ice melt and increased surface temperatures increase the annual surface upward longwave radiation by 27.1 W/m2 and reduce the upward shortwave radiation by 13.2 W/m2, giving an annual net (shortwave plus longwave) surface radiation increase of 5.8 W/m2 , with the maximum changes in summer. \nThe increase in net surface radiation is largely offset by an increased energy loss of 4.4 W/m2 by the turbulent fluxes.",

        "title": "The effect of internal variability on anthropogenic climate projections",
        "abstract": "A single model ensemble of five members, with a CO2 increase of 1% per year, has been used to investigate the spread in climate change estimates. It is furthermore explored how this spread is related to internal variability of the climate system and the strength of the CO2 forcing. As expected, the fraction of the globe where a statistically significant climate change could be detected increased with the strength of the CO2 forcing. For temperature this fraction increased rapidly with integration time, while the increase of areas with statistically significant precipitation change was much slower. It is shown that increasing the averaging periods for estimating climate change from 20 to 40 yr reduced the spread due to internal variability by 40% in the Arctic regions. This is due to better sampling of decadal internal variability. In order to reduce sampling uncertainty below a fixed threshold, the number of ensemble members needed is much larger in the polar region than in the lower latitudes. This should be taken into account when designing modelling strategies (high-resolution modelling versus larger number of ensemble members) to reduce uncertainty in future polar climate change. At the time of doubling of CO2, the variance of the climate change estimates, based on 20 yr averages from a single model ensemble, constitutes 13% and 42% of corresponding multimodel ensemble variances for temperature and precipitation, respectively. In the case of precipitation, this indicates that some caution should be used in attributing different climate change estimates to differences in model formulations.",

        "abstract": "Several impacts of climate change may depend more on changes in mean daily minimum (Tmin) or maximum (Tmax) temperatures than daily averages. To evaluate uncertainties in these variables, we compared projections of Tmin and Tmax changes by 2046-2065 for 12 climate models under an A2 emission scenario. Average modeled changes in Tmin were similar to those for Tmax, with slightly greater increases in Tmin consistent with historical trends exhibiting a reduction in diurnal temperature ranges. In contrast, the inter-model variability of Tmin and Tmax projections exhibited substantial differences. For example, inter-model standard deviations of June-August Tmax changes were more than 50% greater than for Tmin throughout much of North America, Europe, and Asia. Model differences in cloud changes, which exert relatively greater influence on Tmax during summer and Tmin during winter, were identified as the main source of uncertainty disparities. These results highlight the importance of considering separately projections for Tmax and Tmin when assessing climate change impacts, even in cases where average projected changes are similar. In addition, impacts that are most sensitive to summertime Tmin or wintertime Tmax may be more predictable than suggested by analyses using only projections of daily average temperatures.",

        "title": "Impacts of future climate change on California perennial crop yields: model projections with climate and crop uncertainties",
        "abstract": "Most research on the agricultural impacts of climate change has focused on the major annual crops, yet perennial cropping systems are less adaptable and thus potentially more susceptible to damage. In regions where perennial crops are economically and culturally important, improved assessments of yield responses to future climate are needed to prioritize adaptation strategies. These impact assessments, in turn, must rely on climate and crop models that contain often poorly defined uncertainties. We evaluated the impact of climate change on six major perennial crops in California: wine grapes, almonds, table grapes, oranges, walnuts, and avocados. Outputs from multiple climate models were used to evaluate climate uncertainty, while multiple statistical crop models, derived by resampling historical databases, were used to address crop response uncertainties. We find that, despite these uncertainties, climate change in California is very likely to put downward pressure on yields of almonds, walnuts, avocados, and table grapes by 2050. Without CO2 fertilization or adaptation measures, projected losses range from 0 to >40% depending on the crop and the trajectory of climate change. Climate change uncertainty generally had a larger impact on projections than crop model uncertainty, although the latter was substantial for several crops. Opportunities for expansion into cooler regions were identified, but this adaptation would require substantial investments and may be limited by non-climatic constraints. Given the long time scales for growth and production of orchards and vineyards (~30 years), climate change should be an important factor in selecting perennial varieties and deciding whether and where perennials should be planted.",

Under climate change, the storm track and Aleutian Low move northward and intensify. These changes shift precipitation northward along the Pacific coast of North America. In particular, precipitation is intensified over the Pacific Northwest. Results from a statistical downscaling model suggest that precipitation may become more intense both due to the increased frequency of large-scale storms and due to changes in the interaction of these storms with the local terrain.\n\n",

As a result, we showed significantly weaker biases in Walker and monsoon circulations for the JJA climate in the IPCC 20th Century simulations. The dispersal in the scatter diagram of the model biases is considerably large. The same analyses are applied for the IPCC 21st Century simulations to investigate the trends of these tropical circulations in response to the projected global warming. As a result, it is anticipated that Hadley, Walker, and monsoon circulations are weakened by 9, 8, and 14%, respectively, by the late 21st Century, according to the ensemble mean of the IPCC model simulations. Considering the large model biases demonstrated for the IPCC 20th Century simulations, further studies are needed to quantify those trends.",

        "abstract": "In this study, energy spectrum of blocking in the Northern Hemisphere is examined in the framework of the 3D normal mode decomposition using the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis for 51 years. Attention is concentrated to the barotropic component of the atmosphere, where the low-frequency variabilities dominate. The horizontal scale of disturbances is measured by the phase speed of a Rossby mode c instead of the horizontal wavenumber.\nAccording to the result of the energetics analysis in the phase speed domain, we find an accumulation of energy at the spherical Rhines speed cR when a blocking occurs. The energy level at cR exceeds the saturation spectrum E, denoted by E = ac2, which is derived theoretically from the criterion of Rossby wave breaking &#948;q/&#948;y <: 0, where a represents a constant proportional to mass of the atmosphere for the unit area, and q is the barotropic potential vorticity. The amplified Rossby wave persists longer at the same geographical location because the Rossby wave is stationary for the scale of cR. The wave cannot break down easily at the wave regime near cR.\nThe result suggests that an atmospheric blocking occurs when the energy level at cR exceeds the Rossby wave saturation spectrum of E = ac2. The blocking structure is characterized by &#948;q/&#948;y < 0, which represents the saturation criterion of Rossby waves to derive the spectrum of E = ac2.",

Attention is concentrated to the barotropic component of the atmosphere in the framework of the 3D normal mode decomposition.\nAccording to the result of the observational analysis in the phase speed domain, the Arctic Oscillation (AO) is characterized as the energy increase at the meridional index l=3 with simultaneous decrease at l=5 of the zonal field. The result is consistent with the theory of the AO by the singular eigenmode of the global atmosphere. The accumulation of energy at the eigenmode of the AO is explained by the enhanced energy flux FZi associated with the zonal-wave interaction.\nIt is found in this study that the energy flux FZi comes from eddies at the spherical Rhines speed cR where the planetary-scale Rossby wave becomes stationary. The result suggests that the low-frequency variability associated with the AO is maintained by energy flux from cR, which is compensated by the up-scale energy cascade from synoptic eddies in addition to the forced stationary planetary waves by topography.",

        "abstract": "Winter cyclone activity over the Northern Hemisphere is investigated in an ECHAM4/OPYC3 greenhouse gas scenario simulation. The goal of this investigation is to identify changes in cyclone activity associated with increasing concentrations. To this aim, two 50-year time periods are analysed, one representing present day climate conditions and the other a perturbed climate when CO2 concentrations exceed twice the present concentrations. Cyclone activity is assessed using an automatic algorithm, which identifies and tracks cyclones based on sea level pressure fields. The algorithm detects not only large and long living cyclones over the main ocean basins, but also their smaller counterparts in secondary storm track regions like the Mediterranean Basin. For the present climate, results show a good agreement with NCEP-reanalysis, provided that the spectral and time resolutions of the reanalysis are reduced to those available for the model. \n\nSeveral prominent changes in cyclone activity are observed for the scenario period in comparison to the present day climate, especially over the main ocean basins. A significant decrease of overall cyclone track density is found between 35 and 55 degrees North, together with a small increase polewards. These changes result from two different signals for deep and medium cyclones: for deep cyclones (core pressure below 990 hPa) there is a poleward shift in the greenhouse gas scenario, while for medium cyclones (core pressure between 990 and 1010 hPa) a general decrease in cyclone counts is found. The same kind of changes (a shift for intense cyclones and an overall decrease for the weaker ones) are detected when distinguishing cyclones from their intensity, quantified in terms of Laplacian of pressure. Thus, the simulated changes can not solely be attributed to alterations in mean sea level pressure. Instead, corresponding increases in upper-tropospheric baroclinicity suggest more favourable conditions for the development of stronger systems at higher latitudes, especially at the delta regions of the North Atlantic and the North Pacific storm tracks.\n\n",

        "abstract": "Synoptic activity over the Northern Hemisphere is evaluated in ensembles of ECHAM5/MPI-OM1 simulations for recent climate conditions (20C) and for three climate scenarios (following SRES A1B, A2, B1). A close agreement is found between the simulations for present day climate and the respective results from reanalysis. Significant changes in the winter mid-tropospheric storm tracks are detected in all three scenario simulations. Ensemble mean climate signals are rather similar, with particularly large activity increases downstream of the Atlantic storm track over Western Europe. The magnitude of this signal is largely dependent on the imposed change in forcing. However, differences between individual ensemble members may be large. With respect to the surface cyclones, the scenario runs produce a reduction in cyclonic track density over the mid-latitudes, even in the areas with increasing mid-tropospheric activity. The largest decrease in track densities occurs at subtropical latitudes, e.g., over the Mediterranean Basin. An increase of cyclone intensities is detected for limited areas (e.g., near Great Britain and Aleutian Isles) for the A1B and A2 experiments. The changes in synoptic activity are associated with alterations of the Northern Hemisphere circulation and background conditions (blocking frequencies, jet stream). The North Atlantic Oscillation index also shows increased values with enhanced forcing. With respect to the effects of changing synoptic activity, the regional change in cyclone intensities is accompanied by alterations of the extreme surface winds, with increasing values over Great Britain, North and Baltic Seas, as well as the areas with vanishing sea ice, and decreases over much of the subtropics.

        "abstract": "A simple storm loss model is applied to an ensemble of ECHAM5/MPI-OM1 GCM simulations in order to estimate changes of insured loss potentials over Europe in the 21st century. Losses are computed based on the daily maximum wind speed for each grid point. The calibration of the loss model is performed using wind data from the ERA40-Reanalysis and German loss data. The obtained annual losses for the present climate conditions (20C, three realisations) reproduce the statistical features of the historical insurance loss data for Germany.\nThe climate change experiments correspond to the SRES Scenarios\nA1B and A2, and for each of them three realisations are considered. On average, insured loss potentials increase for all analysed European regions at the end of the 21st century. Changes are largest for Germany and France, and lowest for Portugal/Spain. Additionally, the spread between the single realisations is large, ranging e.g. for Germany from +4% to +43% in terms of mean annual loss.\nMoreover, almost all simulations show an increasing interannual variability of storm damage. This assessment is even more pronounced if no adaptation of building structure to climate change is considered. The increased loss potentials are linked with enhanced values for the high percentiles of surface wind maxima over Western and Central Europe, which in turn are associated with an enhanced number and increased intensity of extreme cyclones over the British Isles and the North Sea.",

The storm series in early 1990 and late 1999 led to enormous economic damages and insured claims. Although significant trends in North Atlantic / European storm activity have not been identified for the last few decades, 25 recent studies provide evidence that under anthropogenic climate change the number of extreme storms could increase, whereas the total number of cyclones may be slightly reduced. In this study, loss potentials derived from an ensemble of climate models using a simple storm damage model under climate change conditions are shown. For United Kingdom and Germany ensemble-mean storm-related losses are found to increase by up 30 to 37%.

        "abstract": "This study examines the response of the terrestrial biosphere to changes in climate using the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Land Model's Dynamic Vegetation Model (CLM-DGVM) driven with future climate projections from eight General Circulation Models (GCMs) participating in the fourth assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The simulated potential vegetation under the pre-industrial control (PICNTRL) climate (CO2 concentration held at 275ppm) is compared with that under the SRESA1B after-stabilization climate (CO2 concentration stabilizes at 720ppm beyond 2100). Simulated vegetation changes include increases or decreases of the fractional coverage of different plant functional types and the rather dramatic changes of the dominant plant functional types. Although such changes differ significantly across the different GCM climate projections,  a quite consistent pattern emerges, characterized by a considerable pole-ward spread or shift of temperate and boreal forests in the northern hemisphere high latitudes, and a substantial degradation of vegetation cover in the tropics especially in portions of West and southern Africa and South America. Despite the widespread vegetation degradation in the tropics, net primary productivity (NPP) is predicted to increase under most GCM scenarios over most of the globe. Carbon fluxes to the atmosphere due to fire generally increase too across the globe. Such responses of NPP and fire occurrence result from the synergistic effects of CO2 concentration changes, climate changes, and vegetation changes. A companion paper (in preparation) will examine how the biosphere response documented here influences the impact of climate change on surface hydrological conditions.  ",

The resulting signal resembles the so-called Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) and is presumably associated with intrinsic dynamics of the oceanic thermohaline circulation (THC). While certain phases of the oscillation are dominated by the anomalies in the North Atlantic region, other phases are characterized by global teleconnections to the North Pacific Ocean, Tropical Atlantic Ocean, as well as to the Southern Ocean. In particular, natural variability of sea-surface temperature in the Atlantic hurricanes\u2019 main development region has a peak-to-peak amplitude comparable in magnitude to this region\u2019s surface temperature increase over the past century, for all seasons. Evidence suggests that the AMO influence on secular trends in the global-mean surface temperature can arise via direct, regional, contribution to the surface temperature evolution, as well as via indirect route linked to variability of the oceanic uptake of CO2 associated with AMO-related THC changes.",

        "abstract": "Daily output from fifteen global climate system models and two global reanalyses were analyzed to create a synoptic climatology of Arctic sea level pressure and to assess predicted changes in net precipitation over the Arctic. The method of self-organizing maps was used to create the synoptic climatology from three decades of model output; 1991-2000, 2046-2055, and 2091-2100. The model derived synoptic climatology was compared to that from the two reanalyses, for the period 1991-2000, and this comparison was used to select a subset of models which best reproduced the currently observed synoptic climate of the Arctic. Of the fifteen models evaluated in this way only 4 models were able to reproduce the key features of the Arctic synoptic climate as depicted by the two global reanalyses. The synoptic climatology created using the self-organizing map technique lends itself to the study of extreme events and the projections from this subset of 4 models indicate an increase in cyclonically dominated weather patterns over the 21st century. The models also projected an increase in net precipitation over the Arctic cap and the large Arctic river watersheds during the 21st century. Using the synoptic climatology, a method to assess thermodynamic and circulation related changes in net precipitation was derived. The results of this assessment indicate that thermodynamic changes are responsible for more than 75% of the predicted change in Arctic net precipitation during the 21st century. ",

        "abstract": "Ensembles of simulations of the twentieth- and twentyfirst-century climate, performed with 20 coupled models for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment, provide the basis for an evaluation of the Arctic (70\u00b0&#8211;90\u00b0N) surface energy budget. While the various observational sources used for validation contain differences among themselves, some model biases and across-model differences emerge. For all energy budget components in the twentieth-century simulations (the 20C3M simulation), the across-model variance and the differences from observational estimates are largest in the marginal ice zone (Barents, Kara, Chukchi Seas). Both downward and upward longwave radiation at the surface are underestimated in winter by many models, and the ensenmble mean annual net surface energy loss by longwave radiation is 35 W/m2, which is less than for the NCEP and ERA40 reanalyses but in line with some of the satellite estimates. Incoming solar radiation is overestimated by the models in spring and underestimated in summer and autumn. The ensemble mean annual net surface energy gain by shortwave radiation is 39 W/m2, which is slightly less than for the observational based estimates, In the twentyfirst-century simulations driven by the SRES A2 scenario, increased concentrations of greenhouse gasses increase (average for 2080&#8211;2100 minus average for 1980&#8211;2000 averages) the annual average ensemble mean downward longwave radiation by 30.1 W/m2. This was partly counteracted by a 10.7 W/m2 reduction in downward shortwave radiation. Enhanced sea ice melt and increased surface temperatures increase the annual surface upward longwave radiation by 27.1 W/m2 and reduce the upward shortwave radiation by 13.2 W/m2, giving an annual net (shortwave plus longwave) surface radiation increase of 5.8 W/m2 , with the maximum changes in summer. The increase in net surface radiation is largely offset by an increased energy loss of 4.4 W/m2 by the turbulent fluxes.",

        "abstract": "There were two major multi-year, Arctic-wide (60-90&#61616;N) warm anomalies (> 0.7&#61616;C) in land surface air temperature (LSAT) during the 20th century, between 1920-1950 and again at the end of the century after 1979. Reproducing this decadal and longer variability in coupled General Circulation Models (GCMs) is a critical test for understanding processes in the Arctic climate system and increasing the confidence in the IPCC model projections. Our study evaluated 63 realizations generated by 20 coupled GCMs made available for the IPCC 4th Assessment for their 20th century simulations (20C3M) and corresponding control runs (PIcntrl). Warm anomalies in the Arctic during the last two decades are reproduced by all ensemble members, with considerable variability in amplitude among models. In contrast only eight models generated warm anomaly amplitude at least 2/3 of the observed mid-century warm event in at least one realization, but not its timing. The durations of the mid-century warm events in all the models are decadal, while that of the observed was interdecadal. The variance of the control runs in nine models was comparable with the variance in the observations.  The random timing of mid-century warm anomalies in 20C3M simulations and the similar variance of the control runs in about half of the models suggest that the observed mid-century warm period is consistent with intrinsic climate variability. Five models were considered to compare somewhat favorably to Arctic observations in matching both the variance of the observed temperature record in their control runs and representing the decadal mean temperature anomaly amplitude in their 20C3M simulations. Seven additional models could be given further consideration. Our results support selecting a subset of GCMs when making predictions for future climate by using performance criteria based on comparison with retrospective data.",

Although significant trends in North Atlantic/European storm activity have not been identified for the last few decades, recent studies provide evidence that under anthropogenic climate change the number of extreme storms could increase, whereas the total number of cyclones may be slightly reduced. In this study, loss potentials derived from an ensemble of climate models using a simple storm damage model under climate change conditions are shown. For the United Kingdom and Germany ensemble-mean storm-related losses are found to increase by up to 37%. Furthermore, the interannual variability of extreme events will increase leading to a higher risk of extreme storm activity and related losses.",

Precipitation averaged over monthly, seasonal and annual time periods is considered. The three regions encompass western, central and eastern North America excluding Alaska, northern Canada and Latin America. Most models compare well with observed precipitation for the central and eastern regions at all time scales. For the western region, all models over-predict precipitation at most time scales.

The extreme precipitation events are rather local phenomenon, therefore it would be much appropriate to use regional GCM result for such an assessment purpose. More case studies are needed when regional GCMs are ready available for climate change impact assessment purpose. \n",

        "abstract": "Anthropogenic changes in tropical rainfall are evaluated in a multi-model ensemble of global warming simulations. Major discrepancies on the spatial distribution of these precipitation changes remain in the latest generation models analyzed here. Despite this, we find a number of measures, both global and local, on which reasonable agreement is obtained, notably for the regions of drying trend (negative precipitation anomalies). Models agree on the overall amplitude of the precipitation decreases that occur at the margins of the convective zones, with percent error bars of magnitude similar to those for the tropical warming. Similar agreement is found on a precipitation climate sensitivity defined here, and on differential moisture increase inside and outside convection zones, a step in a hypothesized causal path leading to precipitation changes. A measure of local inter-model agreement on significant trends indicates consistent predictions for particular regions. Observed rainfall trends in several data sets show a significant summer drying trend in a main region of inter-model agreement: the Caribbean/Central-American region.",

        "abstract": "Two IPCC fourth assessment report climate models have Arctic Ocean simulations that become sea-ice-free year around in 1%/year CO2 increase to quadrupling experiments. These runs are examined for evidence of accelerated climate change associated with the removal of sea ice, particularly due to increasing surface albedo feedback. Both models become seasonally ice-free at an annual mean polar temperature of -9\u00b0C without registering much impact on the surface albedo feedback or disturbing the linear relationship between Arctic Ocean climate change and that of the surrounding region. When the polar temperature rises above -5\u00b0C, however, there is a sharp increase in the surface albedo feedback of one of the models, driving an abrupt elimination of Arctic ice and an increase in temperature above that expected from warming of the surrounding region. The transition to ice-free conditions is more linear in the other model, with ocean heat flux playing the primary driving role.",

        "abstract": "Key risks associated with projected climate trends for the 21st-century include the prospects of future climate states with no current analog and the disappearance of some extant climates. Because climate is a primary control on species distributions and ecosystem processes, novel 21st-century climates may promote formation of novel species associations and other ecological surprises, whereas the disappearance of some extant climates increases risk of extinction for species with narrow geographic or climatic distributions and disruption of existing communities. Here we analyze multi-model ensembles for the A2 and B1 emission scenarios produced for the fourth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC AR4), with the goal of identifying regions projected to experience 1) high magnitudes of local climate change, 2) development of novel 21st-century climates, and/or 3) disappearance of extant climates. Novel climates are projected to develop primarily in the tropics and subtropics, whereas disappearing climates are concentrated in tropical montane regions and the poleward portions of continents. Under the high-end A2 scenario, 12-39% and 10-48% of the earth\u2019s terrestrial surface may respectively experience novel and disappearing climates by 2100 AD. Corresponding projections for the low-end B1 scenario are 4-20% and 4-20%. Dispersal limitations increase the risk that species will experience the loss of extant climates or the occurrence of novel climates. There is a close correspondence between regions with globally disappearing climates and previously identified biodiversity hotspots; for these regions, standard conservation solutions (e.g. assisted migration, networked reserves) may be insufficient to preserve biodiversity.",

The well-documented no-analog plant communities in late-glacial North America are closely linked to \u2018novel\u2019 climates also lacking modern analogs, characterized by high temperature seasonality.  In climate simulations for the IPCC A2 and B1 emission scenarios, novel climates arise by 2100AD, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.  These future novel climates are warmer than any present climates globally, with spatially variable shifts in precipitation.  These novel climates increase the risk of species reshuffling into future no-analog communities and other ecological surprises.

        "abstract": "Numerous studies report that intensified precipitation resulting from anthropogenic climate change will stress civil infrastructures. Communities may have a window of opportunity to prepare, but information to support adaptation programs is sparse. For a small city\u2019s watershed, the present culvert system\u2019s capacity for conveying expected peak flow, Qp, resulting from climate change and full build-out was assessed. Least squares regression was used to transfer, to the study site, expected increases to point process location, scale, and regionalized shape parameters for 6 grid points from the GFDL CM-2.1 GCM. Runoff rates and Qp were modeled by the NRCS TR-55 curve number method and HEC-22. Standard civil engineering methods were used to reverse-engineer existing culverts, and replacement costs were estimated using national construction cost estimators. The mid-21st century 25-year precipitation is estimated to be 19% greater than the historical 25-year precipitation. This rate is similar to the 15% rule of thumb proposed by previous research. 43% of culverts likely will be undersized as a result of climate change and population growth, placing people and property at risk. A long-term upgrade program, utilizing existing strategies to manage uncertainty and costs, may maintain historically acceptable risk levels. The scientific, professional, and political communities remain concerned about the significant uncertainy that has not been eliminated from either GCM output or downscaling. However, numerous developments including scientific advancements, uncertainty management techniques, and increasing manifestation of climate change impacts, obviates the prudence of a \"wait-and-see\" strategy. This study proposes that current GCM output and statistical methods can generate reliable and specific estimates of impacts from climate change, in support of programs to adapt civil infrastructures.",

Model results under global warming conditions suggested more warming over land than over the ocean, a northward shift of lower tropospheric monsoon circulation, and an increase in mean precipitation during the Asian summer monsoon. The number of extreme daily precipitation events increased significantly. Increases in mean and extreme precipitation were attributed to greater atmospheric moisture content (a thermodynamic change). In contrast, dynamic changes limited the intensification of mean precipitation. Enhanced extreme precipitation over land in South Asia arose from dynamic changes rather than thermodynamic changes.",

        "abstract": "This study explores the sensitivity of probabilistic predictions of the twenty-first century surface air temperature (SAT) changes to different multi-model averaging methods using available simulations from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change fourth assessment report. A way of observationally constrained prediction is provided by training multi-model simulations for the second half of the twentieth century with respect to long-term components. The Bayesian model averaging (BMA) produces weighted probability density functions (PDFs) and we compare two methods of estimating weighting factors: Bayes factor and expectation\u2013maximization algorithm. It is shown that Bayesian-weighted PDFs for the global mean SAT changes are characterized by multi-modal structures from the middle of the twenty-first century onward, which are not clearly seen in arithmetic ensemble mean (AEM). This occurs because BMA tends to select a few high-skilled models and down-weight the others. Additionally, Bayesian results exhibit larger means and broader PDFs in the global mean predictions than the unweighted AEM. Multi-modality is more pronounced in the continental analysis using 30-year mean (2070\u20132099) SATs while there is only a little effect of Bayesian weighting on the 5\u201395% range. These results indicate that this approach to observationally constrained probabilistic predictions can be highly sensitive to the method of training, particularly for the later half of the twenty-first century, and that a more comprehensive approach combining different regions and/or variables is required.\n\nKeywords: global climate change; Bayesian model averaging; probabilistic prediction; surface air temperature",

We use climate models to study the possible causes of SST changes in Atlantic and Pacific tropical cyclogenesis regions. The observed SST increases in these regions range from 0.32 to 0.67C over the 20th century. The 22 climate models examined here suggest that\ncentury-timescale SST changes of this magnitude cannot be explained solely by unforced variability of the climate system. We employ model simulations of natural internal variability to make probabilistic estimates of the contribution of external forcing to observed SST changes. For the period 1906-2005, we find an 84% chance that external forcing explains at least 67% of observed SST increases in the two tropical cyclogenesis regions. Model \"20th century\" simulations, with external forcing by combined anthropogenic and natural factors, are generally capable of replicating observed SST increases. In experiments where forcing factors are varied individually rather than jointly,\nhuman-caused changes in greenhouse gases are the main driver of the 20th century SST increases in both tropical cyclogenesis regions.",

This reduction of tropical forests increases with the time through the end of the 21st century, mostly over southeastern Amazonia.

        "title": "South Asian Summer Monsoon and Relationship with ENSO in the IPCC AR4 Simulations",
        "abstract": "In this paper the extensive integrations produced for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) are used to examine the relationship between ENSO and monsoons at interannual and decadal time scales. The study begins with an analysis of the monsoon simulation in the twentieth-century integrations. Six of the 18 models were found to have a reasonably realistic representation of monsoon precipitation climatology. For each of these six models SST and anomalous precipitation evolution along the equatorial Pacific during El Ni\u00f1o events display considerable differences when compared to observations. Out of these six models only four [Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Climate Model versions 2.0 and 2.1 (GFDL_CM_2.0 and GFDL_CM_2.1), Meteorological Research Institute (MRI) model, and Max Planck Institute ECHAM5 (MPI_ECHAM5)] exhibit a robust ENSO\u2013monsoon contemporaneous teleconnection, including the known inverse relationship between ENSO and rainfall variations over India. Lagged correlations between the all-India rainfall (AIR) index and Ni\u00f1o-3.4 SST reveal that three models represent the timing of the teleconnection, including the spring predictability barrier, which is manifested as the transition from positive to negative correlations prior to the monsoon onset. Furthermore, only one of these three models (GFDL_CM_2.1) captures the observed phase lag with the strongest anticorrelation of SST peaking 2\u20133 months after the summer monsoon, which is partially attributable to the intensity of the simulated El Ni\u00f1o itself. The authors find that the models that best capture the ENSO\u2013monsoon teleconnection are those that correctly simulate the timing and location of SST and diabatic heating anomalies in the equatorial Pacific and the associated changes to the equatorial Walker circulation during El Ni\u00f1o events.\n\nThe strength of the AIR-Ni\u00f1o-3.4 SST correlation in the model runs waxes and wanes to some degree on decadal time scales. The overall magnitude and time scale for this decadal modulation in most of the models is similar to that seen in observations. However, there is little consistency in the phase among the realizations, suggesting a lack of predictability of the decadal modulation of the monsoon\u2013ENSO relationship.\n\nThe analysis was repeated for each of the four models using results from integrations in which the atmospheric CO2 concentration was raised to twice preindustrial values. From these \u201cbest\u201d models in the double CO2 simulations there are increases in both the mean monsoon rainfall over the Indian subcontinent (by 5%\u201325%) and in its interannual variability (5%\u201310%). For each model the ENSO\u2013monsoon correlation in the global warming runs is very similar to that in the twentieth-century runs, suggesting that the ENSO\u2013monsoon connection will not weaken as global climate warms. This result, though plausible, needs to be taken with some caution because of the diversity in the simulation of ENSO variability in the coupled models that have been analyzed. Implications of the present results for monsoon prediction are discussed.\n\n",

        "abstract": "Observations show both a pronounced increase in ocean heat content (OHC) over the second half of the 20th century and substantial OHC variability on interannual-to-decadal time scales. Although climate models are able to simulate overall changes in OHC, they are generally thought to underestimate the amplitude of OHC variability. Using simulations of 20th century climate performed with 13 numerical models, we demonstrate that the apparent discrepancy between modeled and observed variability is largely explained by accounting for changes in observational coverage and instrumentation and by including the effects of volcanic eruptions. Our work does not support the recent claim that the 0- to 700-m layer of the global ocean experienced a substantial OHC decrease over the 2003 to 2005 time period. We show that the 2003-2005 cooling is largely an artifact of a systematic change in the observing system, with the deployment of Argo floats reducing a warm bias in the original observing system.",

        "abstract": "We show that the ratio of observed annual-mean land temperature change to ocean surface temperature change, f, has remained almost constant during 1955\u20132003. This is the case, despite most of the heat capacity of the climate system lying in the oceans, and rapid variations in climate forcing. Examining seven General Circulation Models (GCMs), we find land and ocean temperature behavior comparable to observations in six cases. For three models that reproduce observed f and for which we have data, we find no significant changes in future f under the SRES A1B scenario. We suggest that variations in land-ocean heat flux primarily balanced by ocean heat uptake are sufficient to maintain constant f. This flux is present in the six GCMs that resemble observations, suggesting that observed f may remain constant into the future, even if radiative forcing is markedly different than in the past.",

        "title": "Hurricanes and global warming:  Results from downscaling IPCC AR4 simulations",
        "abstract": "  Changes in tropical cyclone activity are among the more potentially consequential results of global climate change, and it is therefore of considerable interest to understand how anthropogenic climate change may affect such storms. Global climate models are currently used to estimate future climate change, but the current generation of models lacks the horizontal resolution necessary to resolve the intense inner core of tropical cyclones. Here we review a new technique for inferring  tropical cyclone climatology from the output of global models, extend it to predict genesis climatologies (rather than relying on historical climatology), and apply it to current and future climate states simulated by a suite of global models developed in support of the most recent IPCC report.  This new technique solves the horizontal resolution problem by using a specialized, coupled ocean-atmosphere hurricane model phrased in angular momentum coordinates, which provide high resolution of the core at low cost. This model is run along each of two thousand storm tracks generated using an advection-and-beta model, which is in turn driven by large-scale winds derived from the global models. In an extension to this method, tracks are initiated by randomly seeding large areas of the tropics with weak vortices and then allowing the intensity model to determine their survival, based on large-scale environmental conditions. We show that this method is largely successful in reproducing the observed spatial distribution,  seasonal cycle, and interannual variability of tropical cyclones in the present climate. When applied to simulations of global climate with double the present concentration of carbon dioxide, this method predicts substantial changes and geographic shifts in tropical cyclone activity, but with much variation among the global climate models used.  Changes in basin-wide power dissipation vary greatly from model to model and from basin to basin, but in general, storm frequency decreases and the frequency of landfall events declines nearly everywhere.  We demonstrate that in these simulations, the decrease in tropical cyclone activity is caused by the increasing difference between the moist entropy of the boundary layer and that of the middle troposphere as the climate warms. \n",

        "abstract": " Abstract: The Community Climate System Model version 3 (CCSM3) has a dipolelike pattern with a cold bias in the northern Tropics and a warm bias in the southeastern Tropics, which is reminiscent of the observed pattern of climate variability in boreal spring. Along the equator, in contrast, in boreal spring CCSM3 exhibits striking westerly winds with easterly winds in the upper troposphere, in turn reminiscent of the observed pattern of climate variability in boreal summer. The westerly winds cause a deepening of the eastern thermocline that keeps the east warm despite enhanced coastal upwelling. Thus, the bias in the seasonal cycle of the coupled model appears to project at least partially onto the spatial patterns of natural climate variability in this sector.\n\nInformation about the origin of the bias in CCSM3 is deduced from a comparison of CCSM3 with a simulation using specified historical SST to force the Community Atmospheric Model version 3 (CAM3). The patterns of bias in CAM3 resemble those apparent in CCSM3, including the appearance of substantially intensified subtropical bands of sea level pressure (SLP), indicating that the problem may be traced to difficulties in the atmospheric component model. Positive SLP bias also appears in the western tropical region, which may be related to deficient Amazonian precipitation. The positive SLP bias seems to be the cause of the anomalous westerly trade winds in boreal spring, and those in turn appear to be responsible for the anomalous deepening of the thermocline in the southeastern Tropics.\n",

        "abstract": "The ability of coupled GCMs to correctly simulate the climatology and a prominent mode of variability of the West African monsoon is evaluated, and the results are used to make informed decisions about which models may be producing more reliable projections of future climate in this region. The integrations were made available by the Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison for the 4th Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The evaluation emphasizes the circulation characteristics that support the precipitation climatology, and the physical processes of a \u201crainfall dipole\u201d variability mode that is often associated with dry conditions in the Sahel when SSTs in the Gulf of Guinea are anomalously warm.\nBased on the quality of their 20th century simulations over West Africa in summer, three GCMs are chosen for analysis of the 21st century integrations under various assumptions about future greenhouse gas increases. Each of these models behaves differently in the 21st century simulations. One model simulates severe drying across the Sahel in the later part of the 21st century, while another projects quite wet conditions throughout the 21st century. In the third model, warming in the Gulf of Guinea leads to more modest drying in the Sahel due to a doubling of the number of anomalously dry years by the end of the century. An evaluation of the physical processes that cause these climate changes, in the context of our understanding about how the system works in the 20th century, suggests that the third model is providing the most reasonable projection of 21st century climate.",

        "title": "Interannual to Decadal Predictability of Tropical and North Pacific Sea Surface Temperatures",
        "abstract": "A multivariate empirical model is used to show that predictability of the dominant patterns of tropical and North Pacific oceanic variability, El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO), is mostly limited to little more than a year, despite the presence of spectral peaks on decadal time scales. The model used is a linear inverse model (LIM) derived from the observed simultaneous and 1-yr lag correlation statistics of July\u2013June-averaged SST from the Hadley Centre Global Sea Ice and Sea Surface Temperature (HadISST) dataset for the years 1900\u20132002. The model accurately reproduces the power spectra of the data, including interannual and interdecadal spectral peaks that are significant relative to univariate red noise. Eigenanalysis of the linear dynamical operator yields propagating eigenmodes that correspond to these peaks but have very short decay times and, thus, limited predictability.\n\nLonger-term predictability does exist, however, due to two stationary eigenmodes that are more weakly damped. These eigenmodes do not strongly correspond to the canonical ENSO and PDO patterns. Instead, one is similar to the 1900\u20132002 trend and might represent anthropogenic effects, while the second represents multidecadal fluctuations of a pattern that potentially represents natural decadal variability; however, neither attribution can be made unambiguously with the analysis presented in this paper. Predictability of these two stationary eigenmodes is significantly enhanced by tropical\u2013North Pacific coupling. Neither stationary eigenmode is well captured in the control run of any coupled GCM in the CMIP-3 project of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4), perhaps because in all of the GCMs tropical SST decadal variability is too weak and North Pacific SSTs are too independent of the Tropics.\n\nA key implication of this analysis is that the PDO may represent not a single physical mode but rather the sum of several phenomena, each of which represents a different red noise with its own autocorrelation time scale and spatial pattern. The sum of these red noises can give rise to apparent PDO \u201cregime shifts\u201d and seeming characteristics of a long memory process. Such shifts are not predictable beyond the time scale of the most rapidly decorrelating noise, less than two years, although the expected duration of regimes may be determined from the relative amplitudes of different eigenmodes.",

        "abstract": "Arctic sea ice is an important climate component and often regarded as an early indicator of anthropogenic global change. For an assessment of coupled climate models, their performance with respect to the development of Arctic sea ice thickness during the 20th century is examined. Their behavior is compared with results from an ocean\u2013sea ice model using the Arctic Ocean Model Intercomparison Project (AOMIP) atmospheric forcing for the period 1948\u20132000. In lieu of actually observed sea ice thickness, this model result under realistic atmospheric forcing serves as a benchmark for the coupled climate models. The hindcast exhibits virtually no trend in Arctic ice volume over its integration period 1948\u20132000. Most of the coupled climate models show a negative trend over the 20th century that accelerates towards the end of that century.",

        "title": "On Intrinsic Uncertainties in Earth System Modelling",
        "abstract": "Uncertainties are pervasive in the Earth System modelling. This is not just due to a lack of knowledge about physical processes but has its seeds in intrinsic, i.e. inevitable and irreducible, uncertainties concerning the process of modelling as well. Therefore, it is indispensable to quantify uncertainty in order to determine, which are robust results under this inherent uncertainty. The central goal of this thesis is to explore how uncertainties map on the properties of interest such as phase space topology and qualitative dynamics of the system. We will address several types of uncertainty and apply methods of dynamical systems theory on a trendsetting field of climate research, i.e. the Indian monsoon.\n\nWith a monsoon model the uncertainty about the external influence of El Ni\u00f1o / Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is determined. There is evidence that ENSO influences the variability of the Indian monsoon, but the underlying physical mechanism is discussed controversially. As a contribution to the debate three different hypotheses are tested of how ENSO and the Indian summer monsoon are linked. In this thesis the coupling through the trade winds is identified as key in linking these two key climate constituents. On the basis of this physical mechanism the observed monsoon rainfall data can be reproduced to a great extent. Moreover, this mechanism can be identified in two general circulation models (GCMs) for the present day situation and for future projections under climate change. ",

        "abstract": "Four simulations with atmosphere-ocean climate models have been produced using identical Last Glacial Maximum ice sheets, topography and greenhouse gas concentrations. Compared to the pre-industrial, the diagnosed radiative feedback parameter ranges between $-1.30$ and $-1.18 \\mathrm{Wm^{-2}K^{-1}}$, the tropical ocean sea-surface temperature decreases between $1.7$ and $2.7$ $^\\circ$ C, and Antarctic surface air temperature decreases by 7 to 11 \u00b0C. These values are all compatible with observational estimates, except for a tendency to underestimate the tropical ocean cooling.\nOn the other hand, the same models  have a climate sensitivity to CO$_2$ concentration doubling ranging between 2.1 and 3.9 K\nIt is therefore inappropriate to simply scale an observational estimate of LGM temperature to predict climate sensitivity.\nThis is mainly a consequence of the non-linear character of the cloud (mainly shortwave) feedback at low latitudes. Changes in albedo and cloud cover at mid and high latitudes are also important, but less so.}\n",

        "abstract": "A new set of Climate Change scenarios for 2050 for the Netherlands is produced recently. The scenarios span a wide range of possible future climate conditions, and include climate variables that are of interest to a broad user community. The scenario values are constructed by combining output from an ensemble of recent General Climate Model (GCM) simulations, Regional Climate Model (RCM) output, meteorological observations and a touch of expert judgment. For temperature, precipitation, potential evaporation and wind four scenarios are constructed, encompassing ranges of both global mean temperature rise in 2050 and the strength of the response of the dominant atmospheric circulation in the area of interest to global warming. For this particular area, wintertime precipitation is seen to increase between 3,5 and 7% per degree global warming, but mean summertime precipitation shows opposite signs depending on the assumed response of the circulation regime. Annual maximum daily mean wind speed shows small changes compared to the observed (natural) variability of this variable. Sea level rise in the North Sea in 2100 ranges between 35 and 85 cm. Preliminary assessment of the impact of the new scenarios on water management and coastal defence policies indicate that particularly dry summer scenarios and increased intensity of extreme daily precipitation deserves additional attention in the near future.",

The strength of these teleconnections seems to change over time. Using observations covering the last 128 years we show that these apparent changes can be explained by chance, stemming from sampling variability. This result is backed by experiments in which an atmosphere model is driven by 123 years of observed sea surface temperature. The possibility of ENSO teleconnection changes in a warming climate is further investigated using coupled GCMs driven by past and projected future greenhouse gas concentrations. These runs do not exclude physical changes in the teleconnection strength but do not agree on their magnitude and location. If existing at all, changes in the strength of ENSO teleconnection, other than obtained by chance, are small and will only be detectable on centennial time scales.",

Yet little attention has been paid to the response of these variables in the eastern Pacific Ocean and particularly south eastern Pacific Ocean to anthropogenic climate change. We wish in the following to complete this need by investigating the changes in the heat balance of the oceanic surface layer (air-sea processes and advective terms), at seasonal time scales which may be influenced by the forcing of greenhouse gases at secular time scales in the eastern Pacific with particular emphasis on two areas, Humboldt Current and Panama Bight systems. The Panama Bight  region is located north of the equator (9N-1S, 100W- coastal South America) and the Humboldt Current between 2S-40S, 90W and the coast of South America. In order to performe this research theme, we used monthly mean heat fluxes of all heat flux terms generated by various coupled general circulation models of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. This will allow to gain an improved understanding of the sea surface temperature and the characteristics of the surface heat balance of the Humboldt Current and Panama Bight Systems, their spatial patterns, their seasonal structure, and how they evolve forced by greenhouse gases and other forcing under different scenarios.",

        "abstract": "Recent and potential future increases in global temperatures are likely to be associated with impacts on the hydrologic cycle, including changes to precipitation and increases in extreme events such as droughts. We analyze changes in drought occurrence using soil moisture data for the SRES B1, A1B and A2 future climate scenarios from eight AOGCMs that participated in the IPCC AR4. The models show decreases in soil moisture globally for all future scenarios with a corresponding doubling of the spatial extent of severe soil moisture deficits and frequency of short-term (4-6 month duration) droughts from the mid 20th century to the end of the 21st. Long-term (more than 12 month duration) droughts become three times more common. Regionally, the Mediterranean, west African, central Asian and central American regions show large increases most notably for long term frequencies as do mid latitude North American regions but with larger variation between scenarios. In general, changes under the higher emission scenarios, A1B and A2 are the greatest, and despite following a reduced emissions pathway relative to the present day, the B1 scenario shows smaller but still substantial increases in drought, globally and for most regions. Increases in drought are driven primarily by reductions in precipitation with increased evaporation from higher temperatures modulating the changes. In some regions, increases in precipitation are offset by increased evaporation. Although the predicted future changes in drought occurrence are essentially monotonic increasing globally and in many regions, they are generally not statistically different from natural variability for multiple decades, in contrast to primary climate variables, such as global mean surface air temperature and precipitation. On the other hand, changes in annual and seasonal means of terrestrial hydrologic variables, such as evaporation and soil moisture, are essentially undetectable within the 21st century. Changes in the extremes of climate and their hydrological impacts may therefore be more detectable than changes in their means.",

        "title": "The role of irrigation expansion in past and future temperature trends",
        "abstract": "Expansion of irrigated land can cause local cooling of daytime temperatures by up to several degrees Celsius. Here we compare the expected cooling associated with rates of irrigation expansion in developing countries for historical (1961-2000) and future (2000-2030) periods with climate model predictions of temperature changes from other forcings, most notably increased atmospheric greenhouse gas levels, over the same periods. Indirect effects of irrigation on climate, via methane production in paddy rice systems, were not considered. In regions of rapid irrigation growth over the past 40 years, such as Northwest India and Northeast China, irrigation\u2019s expected cooling effects have been similar in magnitude to climate model predictions of warming from greenhouse gases. A masking effect of irrigation can therefore explain the lack of significant increases in observed growing season maximum temperatures in these regions and the apparent discrepancy between observations and climate model simulations. Projections of irrigation for 2000-2030 indicate a slowing of expansion rates, and therefore cooling from irrigation expansion over this time period will very likely be smaller than in recent decades. At the same time, warming from greenhouse gases will likely accelerate, and irrigation will play a relatively smaller role in agricultural climate trends. In many irrigated regions, therefore, temperature projections from climate models, which generally ignore irrigation, may be more accurate in predicting future temperature trends than their performance in reproducing past observed trends would suggest.",

        "title": "Changes in diurnal temperature range and national cereal yields",
        "abstract": "Models of yield responses to temperature change have often considered only changes in average temperature (Tavg), with the implicit assumption that changes in the diurnal temperature range (DTR; the difference between daily maximum and minimum temperature) can safely be ignored. The goal of this study was to evaluate this assumption using a combination of historical datasets and climate model projections. Data on national crop yields for 1961-2002 in the 10 leading producers of wheat (Triticum spp.), rice (Oryza spp.), and maize (Zea mays) were combined with datasets on climate and crop locations to evaluate the empirical relationships between Tavg, DTR, and crop yields. In several rice and maize growing regions, including the two major nations for each crop, there was a clear negative response of yields to increased DTR. This finding reflects a nonlinear response of yields to temperature, which likely results from greater water and heat stress during hot days. In many other cases, the effects of DTR were not statistically significant, in part because correlations of DTR with other climate variables and the relatively short length of the time series resulted in wide confidence intervals for the estimates.\n\tTo evaluate whether future changes in DTR are relevant to crop impact assessments, yield responses to projected changes in Tavg and DTR by 2046-2065 from 11 climate models were estimated. The mean of climate model projections indicated an increase in DTR in most seasons and locations where wheat is grown, mixed projections for maize, and a general decrease in DTR for rice. These mean projections were associated with wide ranges that included zero in nearly all cases. The estimated impacts of DTR changes on yields were generally small (<5% change in yields) relative to the consistently negative impact of projected warming of Tavg. However, DTR changes did significantly affect yield responses in several cases, such as in reducing US maize yields and increasing India rice yields. Because DTR projections tend to be positively correlated with Tavg, estimates of yield changes for extreme warming were particularly affected by including DTR (up to 10%). Finally, based on the relatively poor performance of climate models in reproducing the magnitude of past DTR trends, it is possible that future DTR changes and associated yield responses will exceed the ranges considered here.\n",

        "abstract": "Warmer SST and more rain in the northern hemisphere are observed year-round\nin the tropical eastern Pacific. Southerly wind blows across the equator toward this atmospheric heating. Southerlies are minimal during boreal spring, when two\nprecipitation maxima straddle the equator. The climate of the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean and atmosphere is analyzed in 15 coupled ocean-atmosphere models from 8 nations. Coupled models variously reproduce the observed meridional march with the seasons of sea surface temperature (SST) and intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) precipitation. Most models have too much rain in the southern hemisphere so that rain is nearly symmetric about the equator in the annual mean. In 8 out of 15 models the ITCZ alternates symmetrically between the hemispheres with the seasons. Simple metrics are introduced to diagnose model fidelity.\n\nSpread of the various solutions from the multi-model ensemble elucidates coupled\nphysics. The seasonally alternating ITCZ error generates two wind speed maxima per year, one northerly and one southerly, resulting in a semiannual cycle of equatorial SST and a cool bias of the equatorial ocean. A spurious cooling occurs in March on the equator in some models. March cold tongue temperature among the models is correlated to the scalar speed of cross-equatorial wind at \u20130.6. Models tend to simulate too weak a meridional asymmetry. Weaker than observed meridional wind within 1000 km of the South American coast explains a warm SST error. SST on the equator (80-90\u00ba W, 2\u00ba S-2\u00ba N) is correlated to meridional wind speed at \u20130.66 among models.\n\nNortheasterly wind jets blow over the Central American isthmus in winter and\ncool the SST in the eastern Pacific warm pool. In some models the strength of these winds contributes to the early demise of their northern ITCZ relative to observations. The February-April northerly wind bias on the equator is correlated to the antecedent December-February Central American Pacific wind speed at \u20130.87, suggesting an atmospheric connection between the Central American northeasterlies and the southward shift of the ITCZ.\n\nThe various representations of stratus clouds among models clearly affect the\nunderlying SST, but their effect on the meridional atmospheric circulation is difficult to discern from the multi-model ensemble. This study identifies several features to be improved in atmospheric and coupled GCMs, including the northeasterly cross-Central American wind in winter and the meridional wind on the equator. It suggests that both the double ITCZ error and equatorial SST errors in the eastern Pacific could be alleviated by reducing errors in the climatology of meridional wind.",

In contrast\nto the strengthening and contraction of the Hadley cell and the equatorward shift of the\ntropospheric zonal jets in response to El Nino, the Hadley cell weakens and expands poleward, and\nthe jets move poleward under a warmed climate, despite the ~SEl Nino-like~T enhanced warming over\nequatorial central and eastern Pacific.\nTwo feasible mechanisms are proposed for the zonal mean circulation response to global warming:\n(1) The increase in static stability of the subtropical and mid-latitude troposphere, a result of\nthe quasi-moist adiabatic adjustment to the surface warming, tends to stabilize the eddy growth\non the equatorward side of the storm track and push the eddy activity and the associated\neddy-driven wind and subsidence poleward, leading to the poleward expansion of the Hadley cell\nand the shift of jet; (2) the strengthening of the mid-latitude wind at the upper-troposphere and\nlower-stratosphere, arguably a consequence of the rise in the height of the tropopause and the\nassociated increase in the meridional temperature gradient, can increase the phase speed of the\neddies emanating from the mid-latitudes, and thus the critical latitudes (where the eddy phase\nspeed matches the background zonal wind, and where the eddies break and extract angular momentum\nfrom the thermally driven wind) displace poleward and carry the eddy-driven circulation with it.\nBoth mechanisms are somewhat, if not completely, distinct from those in response to the El Nino\ncondition. The hydrological impacts of global warming also exhibit distinct patterns over the\nsubtropics and mid-latitudes in comparison to the El Nino.\nSince both mechanisms do not essentially depend on the details of the SST warming in the\nequatorial oceans and the variety of model physical parameterizations, these extratropical\nresponses to global warming may be of increased credence due to the fact that they are\ndynamically determined.",

        "title": "On the reliability of simulated Arctic sea ice in global climate models",
        "abstract": "While most of the global climate models (GCMs) currently being evaluated for the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report simulate present-day Arctic sea ice in reasonably good agreement with observations, the intermodel differences in simulated Arctic cloud cover are large and produce significant differences in downwelling longwave radiation. Using the standard thermodynamic models of sea ice, we find that the GCM-generated spread in longwave radiation produces equilibrium ice thicknesses that range from 1 to more than 10 meters. However, equilibrium ice thickness is an extremely sensitive function of the ice albedo, allowing errors in simulated cloud cover to be compensated by tuning of the ice albedo. This analysis suggests that the results of current GCMs cannot be relied upon at face value for credible predictions of future Arctic sea ice.",

        "abstract": "We examine the trajectory of Arctic summer sea ice in seven projections from the Community Climate System Model and find that abrupt reductions are a common feature of these 21st century simulations. These events have decreasing September ice extent trends that are typically 4 times larger than comparable observed trends. One event exhibits a decrease from 6 million square km to 2 million square km in a decade, reaching near ice-free September conditions by 2040. In the simulations, ice retreat accelerates as thinning increases the open water formation efficiency for a given melt rate and the ice-albedo feedback increases shortwave absorption. The retreat is abrupt when ocean heat transport to the Arctic is rapidly increasing. Analysis from multiple climate models and three forcing scenarios indicates that abrupt reductions occur in simulations from over 50% of the models and suggests that reductions in future greenhouse gas emissions moderate the likelihood of these events.",

        "abstract": "This study investigates the temporal variability of the South America monsoon system (SAMS) over Brazil with focus on the Brazilian savanna. The onset, end, and total rainfall during the summer monsoon are investigated using precipitation pentad estimates from the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (1979-2004). Likewise, the variability of SAMS characteristics are investigated using the intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) coupled global climate model for Interdisciplinary Research (MIROC) in the 20th century (1981-2000) and in a scenario with the double present concentration of CO2 (2xCO2) (2061-2080).. It is shown that the spatial variability of the onsets over central Brazil simulated by MIROC for the 20th century run corresponds very well to the observations. Moreover, there is indication of change in the tails of the seasonal precipitation distributions over the savanna for the scenario with 2xCO2, comparatively to the present climate. This suggests changes in the probability of extremes (dry or wet) events over that region in a scenario with 2xCO2, which indicates according to MIROC the large exposure of the region to possible consequences of climate changes resulting from increasing greenhouse gases.",

        "abstract": "The analyses presented here forcus on the Southern Ocean as simulated in a set of global coupled climate model control experiments conducted by several international climate modeling groups. Dominated by the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), the vast Southern Ocean can influence large-scale surface climate features on various time scales. Its climatic relevance stems in part from it being the region where most of the transformation of the World Ocean's water masses occur. In climate change experiments that simulate greenhouse gas-induced warming. Southern Ocean air-sea heat fluxes and three-dimensional circulation patterns make it a region where much of the future oceanic heat storage takes place, though the magnitude of that heat storage is one of the larger sources of uncertainty associated with the transient climate response in such model projections. Factors such as the Southern Ocean's wind forcing, heat, and salt budgets are linked to the structure and transport of the ACC in ways that have not been expresed clearly in the literature. These links are explored here in a coupled model context by analyzing a sizable suite of preindustrial control experiments associated with the forthcoming Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Fourth Assessment Report. A framework is developed that uses measures of coupled model simulation characteristics, primarily those related to the Southern Ocean wind forcing and water mass properties, to allow one to categorize, and to some extent predict, which models do better or worse at simulating the Southern Ocean and why. Hopefully, this framework will also lead to increased understanding of the ocean's response to climate changes.",

We compare 1xCO2 and 2xCO2 CAM simulations against similar simulations with snow cover fraction purposely increased. Greater snow cover fraction leads to higher albedo and lower temperatures at 1xCO2 but has less influence at 2xCO2 when little snow remains due to global warming. This makes the simulation with higher albedo at 1xCO2 more sensitive to increased CO2, in agreement with past work. We show that the wide variation in simulated snow-albedo feedbacks and climate sensitivities among 15 other models correlates well with variations in the continental middle to high latitude present-day springtime albedo, in agreement with our CAM results. The development of more accurate snow and albedo parameterizations should improve model estimates of climate sensitivity.",

        "abstract": " The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has recently completed its Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) \u201cClimate Change 2007\u201d. Results from comprehensive numerical models of the climate system are fundamentally important for understanding climate processes and how climate has changed in the past and may change in the future.\nSome time ago CSIRO completed its submission to the IPCC AR4 Model database a set of experiments simulating past, present and future climate with the Mk3 Climate System. The Mk3 model has been in development and used for production climate runs for the best part of a decade and is the end result of a significant commitment of financial and intellectual resources from a relatively small group of developers and stakeholders.\nThe task of processing, deriving, validating and submitting Mk3 output provided significant computing and logistic challenges. Data requirements were substantially more demanding than ever before and the schedule for inclusion in the AR4 database was extremely tight. Particularly when several key model experiments were still underway when the call for data (from JSC/CLIVAR WGCM) came. However, the importance of contributing to the IPCC AR4 with a climate model developed in the Southern Hemisphere cannot be underestimated. This effort will provide a useful \u201cmodel development\u201d yardstick for the ACCESS  climate model development program that is underway in Australia. The best indicator of the Mk3 outcome is the inclusion of its performance in hundreds of peer-reviewed scientific articles and the many contractual reports completed and underway.\nWe briefly described the system for managing Mk3 model output based on a modern, locally developed, scripting computer language for the efficient processing of large and complex datasets. This system takes into account different Mk3 model configurations and model output inconsistencies and is able to generate a temporally, spatially and physically consistent set of data products. An essential feature is the ability to make the model results self describing (CF-compliant netCDF files) to enable efficient uptake by researchers. Experiences with data validation and quality control checking is described, an often overlooked aspect of data delivery. Our goal was to make the Mk3 model output easily accessible its to the international climate research community.\nIn this presentation a brief history of the development and features of the CSIRO Mk3 model will be provided. The Mk3.5 version of the climate model includes many improvements over its predecessor resulting in a control climate with a relatively small drift.  This new and updated archive of model outputs will provide the local and international community with a wealth of informative and sophisticated climate model experiments for completion of important institutional studies. An indication of the regional demands for Mk3 outputs will be given. Details of how to access the CSIRO Mk3.0 and Mk3.5 data will be provided.\n",

        "abstract": "Trustworthy probabilistic projections of regional climate are essential for society to plan for future climate change, and yet, by the nonlinear nature of climate, finite computational models of climate are inherently deficient in their ability to simulate regional climatic variability with complete accuracy. How can we determine whether specific regional climate projections may be untrustworthy in the light of such generic deficiencies? A calibration method is proposed whose basis lies in the emerging notion of seamless prediction. Specifically, calibrations of ensemble-based climate-change probabilities are derived from analyses of the statistical reliability of ensemble-based forecast probabilities on seasonal timescales. The method is demonstrated by calibrating probabilistic projections from the multi-model ensembles used in the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), based on reliability analyses from the seasonal-forecast DEMETER dataset. The focus in this paper is on climate-change projections of regional precipitation, though the method is more general.",

The results demonstrate good model agreement in quantities that have had a robust global observational basis and that are physically unambiguous.  The worst agreement occurs for quantities that have both poor observational constraints and whose model representations can be physically ambiguous.  In addition, components involving water vapor (frozen water) typically exhibit the best (worst) agreement, and fluxes typically exhibit better agreement than reservoirs. These results are discussed in relation to the importance of obtaining accurate model representation of the water cycle and its role in climate change.

        "title": "Quantifying Climate Feedbacks using Radiative Kernels",
        "abstract": "The extent to which the climate will change due to an external forcing depends largely on\nradiative feedbacks, which act to amplify or damp the surface temperature response. Differences\nin the representation of these feedbacks are directly responsible for the uncertainty in current\nmodel estimates of climate sensitivity. There are a variety of issues that complicate the analysis\nof radiative feedbacks in global climate models (GCMs), resulting in some confusion regarding\ntheir strength and distribution. In this paper, we present a method for quantifying climate\nfeedbacks based on \u201cradiative kernels\u201d which describe the differential response of the top-ofatmosphere\nradiative fluxes to incremental changes in the feedback variables. The use of\nradiative kernels enables one to decompose the feedback into one part that depends on the\nradiative transfer algorithm and the unperturbed climate state, and a second part that arises\nfrom the climate response of the feedback variables. Such decomposition facilitates an\nunderstanding of the spatial characteristics of the feedbacks and the causes of intermodel\ndifferences. This technique has the advantage of requiring fewer computations and being easier\nto implement than \u201cpartial radiative perturbation\u201d methods. More importantly, it provides a\nsimple and accurate way to compare feedbacks across different models using a consistent\nmethodology. Cloud feedbacks cannot be evaluated directly from a cloud radiative kernel\nbecause of strong nonlinearities, but they can be estimated from the change in cloud forcing and\nthe difference between the full-sky and clear-sky kernels. Our results using this method confirm\nthat models typically generate globally-averaged cloud feedbacks that are substantially positive\nor near neutral, unlike the change in cloud forcing itself which is as often negative as positive.",

The method indicates that in many models there is a significant rapid tropospheric adjustment to CO2 leading to changes in cloud, and reducing the effective radiative forcing, in a way analogous to the indirect and semi-direct effects of aerosol. By contrast, in most models the cloud feedback is small, defined as the part of the change which evolves with Delta-T. Comparison with forcing evaluated by fixing sea surface conditions gives qualitatively similar results for the cloud components of forcing, both  globally and locally. Tropospheric adjustment to CO2 may be responsible for some of the model spread in equilibrium climate sensitivity, and could affect time-dependent climate projections.",

        "title": "Increasing CO2 may compensate for the adverse effects of changing climate on China's ecosystems",
        "abstract": "Atmospheric CO2 and China\u2019s climate have changed greatly since 1961.  How increased CO2 and changing climate influence the carbon cycle of the terrestrial China ecosystems is still unclear although it is important to understand the carbon dynamics.  In this article, we used a process-based ecosystem model, Biome-BGC, to isolate the effects of changing climate and elevated atmospheric CO2 on the terrestrial China carbon cycle during two time periods, (1) the present (1961-2000) and (2) a future with projected climate change under doubled CO2 (2071-2110).  The effects of climate change alone were estimated by driving Biome-BGC with the fixed CO2 and the changing climate, and the CO2 fertilization effects were the difference of the results driven by both increasing CO2 and changing climate to those by variable climate alone.  Model simulations indicate that, during 1961-2000, at the national scale, climate change alone reduced carbon stored in China\u2019s ecosystems, but increasing CO2 compensated for the adverse effects of climate change, resulting in the increased carbon storage by China\u2019s ecosystems despite of the decreased soil carbon.  The interannual variability of the carbon cycle was associated with climate variations.  Spatially, the normally reduced carbon in vegetation and soils, and the raised carbon in litter were mainly caused by climate change in most parts of East China, while carbon in vegetation, soils and litter increased nearly all over West China.  In the future (2071-2110), with doubled CO2, higher precipitation and temperature will occur all over China as predicted by the Hadley Centre HadCM3 for the IPCC Fourth Assessment.  The concomitant doubling of CO2 will continue to counteract the negative effects of climate change on carbon uptake in the future, leading to an increase in carbon storage relative to the present.  Regional differences in climate change produced differing regional carbon uptake responses.  This study highlights the role of CO2 fertilization in the carbon budget of China ecosystems, though it did not include other important processes such as land use change, human management practices (e.g., fertilization, irrigation) and environmental pollutions, etc.",

        "abstract": "Changes in snow amount, as measured by the water equivalent of the snow pack (SWE), are studied using simulations of 21st century climate by 20 global climate models. Although the simulated warming makes snow season to shorten from its both ends in all of Eurasia and North America, SWE at the height of the winter generally increases in the coldest areas. Elsewhere, snow decreases throughout the winter. The average borderline between increasing and decreasing midwinter SWE coincides broadly with the &#8722;20\u00b0C isotherm in late 20th century November\u2013March mean temperature, although with some variability between different areas. On the colder side of this isotherm, an increase in total precipitation generally dominates over reduced fraction of solid precipitation and more efficient melting, and SWE therefore increases. On the warmer side, where the phase of winter precipitation and snowmelt are more sensitive to the simulated warming, the reverse happens. The strong temperature dependence of the simulated SWE changes suggests that projections of SWE change could be potentially improved by taking into account biases in simulated present-day winter temperatures. A probabilistic cross verification exercise supports this suggestion.",

        "abstract": "Observed changes in the timing of snowmelt dominated streamflow in the western United States are often linked to anthropogenic or other external causes. We assess whether observed streamflow timing changes can be statistically attributed to external forcing, or whether they still lie within the bounds of natural (internal) variability for four large Sierra Nevada (CA) basins, at inflow points to major reservoirs. Streamflow timing is measured by \u2018\u2018center timing\u2019\u2019 (CT), the day when half the annual flow has passed a given point. We use a physically based hydrology model driven by meteorological input from a global climate model to quantify the natural variability in CT trends. Estimated\n50-year trends in CT due to natural climate variability often exceed estimated actual CT trends from 1950 to 1999. Thus, although observed trends in CT to date may be statistically significant, they cannot yet be statistically attributed to external influences on climate. We estimate that projected CT changes at the four major reservoir inflows will, with 90% confidence, exceed those from natural variability within 1\u20134 decades or 4\u20138 decades, depending on rates of future greenhouse gas emissions. To identify areas most likely to exhibit CT changes in response to rising temperatures, we calculate changes in CT under temperature increases from 1 to 5\u0001. We find that areas with  average winter temperatures between \u00012\u0001C and \u00014\u0001C are most likely to respond with\nsignificant CT shifts. Correspondingly, elevations from 2000 to 2800 m are most sensitive to temperature increases, with CT changes exceeding 45 days (earlier) relative to 1961\u20131990.",

        "abstract": "Climate model simulations available from the PMIP1, PMIP2 and CMIP (IPCC-AR4) intercomparison projects for past and future climate change simulations are examined in terms of polar temperature changes in comparison to global temperature changes and with respect to pre-industrial reference simulations. For the mid-Holocene (MH, 6,000 years ago), the models are forced by changes in the Earth\u2019s orbital parameters. The MH PMIP1 atmosphere-only simulations conducted with sea surface temperatures fixed to modern conditions show no MH consistent response for the poles, whereas the new PMIP2 coupled atmosphere\u2013 ocean climate models systematically simulate a significant MH warming both for Greenland (but smaller than ice-core based estimates) and Antarctica (consistent with the range of ice-core based range). In both PMIP1 and PMIP2, the MH annual mean changes in global temperature are negligible, consistent with the MH orbital forcing. The simulated last glacial maximum (LGM, 21,000 years ago) to pre-industrial change in global mean temperature ranges between 3 and 7degC in PMIP1 and PMIP2 model runs, similar to the range of temperature change expected from a quadrupling of atmospheric CO2 concentrations in the CMIP simulations. Both LGM and future climate simulations are associated with a polar amplification of climate change. The range of glacial polar amplification in Greenland is strongly dependent on the ice sheet elevation changes prescribed to the climate models. All PMIP2 simulations systematically underestimate the reconstructed glacial\u2013interglacial Greenland temperature change, while some of the simulations do capture the reconstructed glacial\u2013interglacial Antarctic temperature change. Uncertainties in the prescribed central ice cap elevation cannot account for the temperature change underestimation by climate models. The variety of climate model sensitivities enables the exploration of the relative changes in polar temperature with respect to changes in global temperatures. Simulated changes of polar temperatures are strongly related to changes in simulated global temperatures for both future and LGM climates, confirming that ice-core-based reconstructions provide quantitative insights on global climate changes.",

        "abstract": "Ice cores provide unique archives of past climate and environmental changes based only on physical processes. Quantitative temperature reconstructions are essential for the comparison between ice core records and climate models. We give an overview of the methods that have been developed to reconstruct past local temperatures from deep ice cores and highlight several points that are relevant for future climate change.\nWe first analyse the long term fluctuations of temperature as depicted in the long Antarctic record from EPICA Dome C. The long term imprint of obliquity changes in the EPICA Dome C record is highlighted and compared to simulations conducted with the ECBILT-CLIO intermediate complexity climate model. We discuss the comparison between the current interglacial period and the long interglacial corresponding to marine isotopic stage 11, ca. 400 kyr BP. Previous studies had focused on the role of precession and the thresholds required to induce glacial inceptions. We suggest that, due to the low eccentricity configuration of MIS 11 and the Holocene, the effect of precession on the incoming solar radiation is damped and that changes in obliquity must be taken into account. The EPICA Dome C alignment of terminations I and VI published in 2004 corresponds to a phasing of the obliquity signals. A conjunction of low obliquity and minimum northern hemisphere summer insolation is not found in the next tens of thousand years, supporting the idea of an unusually long interglacial ahead.\nAs a second point relevant for future climate change, we discuss the magnitude and rate of change of past temperatures reconstructed from Greenland (NorthGRIP) and Antarctic (Dome C) ice cores. Past episodes of temperatures above the present-day values by up to 5degC are recorded at both locations during the penultimate interglacial period. The rate of polar warming simulated by coupled climate models forced by a CO2 increase of 1% per year is compared to ice-core-based temperature reconstructions. In Antarctica, the CO2-induced warming lies clearly beyond the natural rhythm of temperature fluctuations. In Greenland, the CO2-induced warming is as fast or faster than the most rapid temperature shifts of the last ice age. The magnitude of polar temperature change in response to a quadrupling of atmospheric CO2 is comparable to the magnitude of the polar temperature change from the Last Glacial Maximum to present-day. When forced by prescribed changes in ice sheet reconstructions and CO2 changes, climate models systematically underestimate the glacial-interglacial polar temperature change.",

        "abstract": "The state-of-the-art AOGCM simulations has recently (late 2004 - early 2005) been completed for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in order to provide input to the IPCC\u2019s Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). The present paper synthesizes the new simulations of both the 20th- and 21st-century arctic freshwater budget components for use in the IPCC AR4, and attempts to determine whether demonstrable progress has been achieved since the late 1990s. Precipitation and its difference with evapotranspiration are addressed over the Arctic Ocean and its terrestrial watersheds, including the basins of the four major rivers draining into the Arctic Ocean: the Ob, the Yenisey, the Lena, and the Mackenzie. Compared to the previous (IPCC Third Assessment Report, TAR) generation of AOGCMs, there are some indications that the models as a class have improved in simulations of the arctic precipitation. In spite of observational uncertainties, the models still appear to oversimulate area-averaged precipitation over the major river basins. The model-mean precipitation biases in the Arctic and sub-Arctic have retained their major geographical patterns, which are at least partly attributable to the insufficiently resolved local orography, as well as to biases in large scale atmospheric circulation and sea-ice distribution. The river discharge into the Arctic Ocean is also slightly oversimulated. The simulated annual cycle of precipitation over the Arctic Ocean is in qualitative agreement between the models as well as with observational and reanalysis data. This is also generally the case for the seasonality of precipitation over the Arctic Ocean\u2019s terrestrial watersheds, with a few exceptions. Some agreement is demonstrated by the models in reproducing positive 20th century trends of precipitation in the Arctic, as well as positive area-averaged P-E late-20th century trends over the entire terrestrial watershed of the Arctic Ocean.\nFor the 21st century, three scenarios are considered: A2, A1B, and B1. Precipitation over the Arctic Ocean and its watersheds increases through the 21st century, showing much faster percentage increases than the global mean precipitation. The arctic precipitation changes have a pronounced seasonality, with the strongest relative increase in winter and fall, and the weakest in summer. The river discharge into the Arctic Ocean increases for all scenarios from all major river basins considered, and is generally about twice as large as the increase of freshwater from precipitation over the Arctic Ocean (70-90\u00b0N) itself. The across-model scatter of the precipitation increase for each scenario is significant, but smaller than the scatter between the climates of the different models in the baseline period.",

        "title": "ntrinsic versus forced variation in coupled climate model simulations over the Arctic during the 20th Century",
        "abstract": "There were two major multi-year, Arctic-wide (60-90&#61616;N) warm anomalies (> 0.7&#61616;C) in land surface air temperature (LSAT) during the 20th century, between 1920-1950 and again at the end of the century after 1979. Reproducing this decadal and longer variability in coupled General Circulation Models (GCMs) is a critical test for understanding processes in the Arctic climate system and increasing the confidence in the IPCC model projections. Our study evaluated 63 realizations generated by 20 coupled GCMs made available for the IPCC 4th Assessment for their 20th century simulations (20C3M) and corresponding control runs (PIcntrl). Warm anomalies in the Arctic during the last two decades are reproduced by all ensemble members, with considerable variability in amplitude among models. In contrast only eight models generated warm anomaly amplitude at least 2/3 of the observed mid-century warm event in at least one realization, but not its timing. The durations of the mid-century warm events in all the models are decadal, while that of the observed was interdecadal. The variance of the control runs in nine models was comparable with the variance in the observations. The random timing of mid-century warm anomalies in 20C3M simulations and the similar variance of the control runs in about half of the models suggest that the observed mid-century warm period is consistent with intrinsic climate variability. Five models were considered to compare somewhat favorably to Arctic observations in matching both the variance of the observed temperature record in their control runs and representing the decadal mean temperature anomaly amplitude in their 20C3M simulations. Seven additional models could be given further consideration. Our results support selecting a subset of GCMs when making predictions for future climate by using performance criteria based on comparison with retrospective data.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: This paper presents a methodology to downscale monthly precipitation to river basin scale in Indian context\nfor special report of emission scenarios (SRES) using Support Vector Machine (SVM). In the methodology presented,\nprobable predictor variables are extracted from (1) the National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis\ndata set for the period 1971\u20132000 and (2) the simulations from the third generation Canadian general circulation model\n(CGCM3) for SRES emission scenarios A1B, A2, B1 and COMMIT for the period 1971\u20132100. These variables include\nboth the thermodynamic and dynamic parameters and those which have a physically meaningful relationship with the\nprecipitation. The NCEP variables which are realistically simulated by CGCM3 are chosen as potential predictors for\nseasonal stratification. The seasonal stratification involves identification of (1) the past wet and dry seasons through\nclassification of the NCEP data on potential predictors into two clusters by the use of K-means clustering algorithm\nand (2) the future wet and dry seasons through classification of the CGCM3 data on potential predictors into two clusters\nby the use of nearest neighbour rule. Subsequently, a separate downscaling model is developed for each season to capture\nthe relationship between the predictor variables and the predictand. For downscaling precipitation, the predictand is chosen\nas monthly Thiessen weighted precipitation for the river basin, whereas potential predictors are chosen as the NCEP\nvariables which are correlated to the precipitation and are also realistically simulated by CGCM3. Implementation of the\nmethodology presented is demonstrated by application to Malaprabha reservoir catchment in India which is considered to\nbe a climatically sensitive region. The CGCM3 simulations are run through the calibrated and validated SVM downscaling\nmodel to obtain future projections of predictand for each of the four emission scenarios considered. The results show\nthat the precipitation is projected to increase in future for almost all the scenarios considered. The projected increase in\nprecipitation is high for A2 scenario, whereas it is least for COMMIT scenario.",

        "abstract": "This paper documents the low-frequency (i.e., decadal) variations of surface temperature \nfor the period 1899-1998 in observations, and in simulations conducted as part of the \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4).  The \nspace-time structure of low-frequency variations are extracted using Optimal Persistence \nAnalysis, which is a technique that linearly decomposes a vector time series into a set of \nuncorrelated components, ordered such that the first component maximizes the decorrelation \ntime, the second maximizes the decorrelation time subject to being uncorrelated with the first, \nand so on.  The results suggests that only the first two optimal persistence patterns (OPPs) in the \nobservation-based record are statistically distinguishable from white noise.  These two \ncomponents can reproduce the spatial structure of local linear trends over various multi-decadal \nperiods, indicating that they give an efficient representation of the observed change in surface \ntemperature.  In contrast, most simulations suggest the existence of a single physically significant \nOPP, all with qualitatively similar time series but each with somewhat different spatial structure. \nThe leading OPP computed from the full model grid, and from the observation based grid and \nmissing data masked out, are surprisingly consistent with each other, suggesting that the \nobservation-based grid does not pose a serious barrier to extracting the dominant low-frequency \nvariations in the global climate system.  The regions in which the leading optimal persistence \npatterns agree in their predictions of warming coincides with the regions in which warming has \nin fact been observed to occur.  ",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we assess and compare to observations the spatial characteristics of the twentieth Century ENSO SST variability simulated by 23 models of the IPCC-AR4/CMIP3 database. The analysis is confined to the SST anomalies along the equatorial Pacific and is based on the use of a non-linear neural classification algorithm, the Self-Organizing Maps. Systematic biases include a larger than observed proportion for modelled ENSO maximum variability occurring in the Western Pacific. No clear relationship is found between this bias and the characteristics of the modelled mean state bias in the equatorial Pacific. This bias is mainly related to a misrepresentation of both El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a termination phases for most of the models. In contrast, the onset phase is quite well simulated. Modelled El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a peak phases display an asymmetric bias. Whereas the main bias of the modelled El Ni\u00f1o peak is to exhibit a maximum in the western Pacific, the simulated La Ni\u00f1a bias mainly occurs in the central Pacific. In addition, some models are able to capture the observed El Ni\u00f1o peak characteristics while none of them realistically simulate La Ni\u00f1a peaks. It also arises that the models closest to the observations score unevenly in reproducing the different phases, preventing an accurate classification of the models quality to reproduce the overall ENSO-like variability.",

        "title": "The Impact of 21st Century Climate Change on Global Forest Fire Hazards (undergraduate thesis)",
        "abstract": "Forest fires are a global hazard. Antarctica is the only continent entirely free from the combinations of fuels, weather conditions and ignition sources, which provide a potential wildfire hazard. Some regions such as California, Australia and the Mediterranean exhibit particular susceptibility to forest fires, and research throughout the 20th century established a strong correlation between meteorological variables and fire occurrence and extent. Since then, a number of fire-weather indices have been established which allow the seasonal and daily forecasting of fire hazards in these regions. The past decade has seen significant interest in the impact of anthropogenic climate forcing on the occurrence of forest fires, focused on the most fire-prone regions, predicting overall increases in fire-weather in Australia, Spain, Portugal and South-west U.S.A. An increase in fire-susceptibility has also been predicted for parts of the boreal forests of Canada and Russia. However, no global overview has been presented, and little interest is given to regions with a currently low fire danger, which may or may not experience an increase in forest fire occurrence in the future.\n\n\n\nThis study asks \u2018can we expect a change in the global distribution of forest fires due to anthropogenic climate change?\u2019 This question is of great significance due to the environmental, social and economic damage caused by forest fires. This damage may possibly be even greater in regions previously free of major fire hazards as they lack the management experience of current fire-prone regions. The increased occurrence of fire in forested regions not adapted to periodic fire seasons may also have significant ecological impact. \n\n\n\nA secondary purpose of this study is to evaluate the applicability of a regional fire weather index to the global climate model. This study uses the ECHAM climate model data for the 4th IPCC Assessment along with the McArthur Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI) to compare the global distribution of forest fire weather in 2080 under a 2xCO2 climate with that of today. The model results are validated against observed forest fire data for the past 20 years. This validation enables the study to be evaluated as a model for predicting the impact of anthropogenic climate change on the global distribution of the forest fire hazard.\n\n\n\nValidation of the model suggests that it is useful as a predictive tool on a global scale, and also on a regional scale in Africa, China, Canada and Europe. For other regions alterations to the model are required to produce a more useful output. This study predicts a significant overall increase in global forest fire danger, with significant increases in Australia, Africa, South America, China, Canada and Europe. Other regions are predicted insignificant changes in fire danger.\n\n",

        "abstract": "Using outputs from the pre-industrial control run of the CMIP3 coupled GCMs, seasonal variations of the Seychelles Dome (SD) in the southwestern Indian Ocean are examined.  The observed SD shows a dominant semiannual signal due to the semiannual variation in the local Ekman upwelling resulting from a combination of the term related to the wind stress curl and the zonal wind stress.  However, all models failed to reproduce this important mechanism.  In particular, the latter contribution, which is determined by the seasonal variation of the zonal wind stress associated with the Indian monsoon, is not well simulated.  Successful models need to reproduce the asymmetric nature of the monsoon: shorter and stronger summer monsoon and longer and weaker winter monsoon.  Possible remedies for the model bias are also discussed.",

        "abstract": "Equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS, globally averaged surface air temperature response to atmospheric CO2 doubling) is estimated by using atmosphere-slab ocean coupled general circulation models (ASGCMs) in which physical processes in the ocean have been simplified. In order to investigate the effect of this simplification in ASGCMs on ECS estimation, a climate feedback analysis was performed doubled CO2 equilibrium experiments (2XCO2) by ASGCM and 1% per year CO2 increase experiments (1%CO2) by atmosphere-ocean coupled general circulation models (AOGCMs, in which physical processes in the ocean are considered explicitly). In some models, the strength of ice-albedo and cloud feedback in 2XCO2 is different from those in 1%CO2. The possible factors controlling these feedbacks in 1%CO2 seem more reliable than those \nin 2XCO2 because the ocean physical processes are accounted for appropriately in 1%CO2. If we assume the strength of ice-albedo and cloud feedback in 1%CO2 to be more accurate than that in 2XCO2, the ECS changes about 1 K in some models. In order to decrease the uncertainty in estimating ECS resulting from such artificial problems in the experimental settings of ASGCMs, it is important to make the initial sea ice distribution and the surface temperature response as realistic as possible.

Here we show results from two global coupled climate models run with anthropogenic and natural forcings separately. Averaged over the continental U.S., they show that the observed changes in the four temperature extremes are accounted for with anthropogenic forcings, but not with natural forcings (even though there are some differences in the details of the forcings). This indicates that most of the changes in temperature extremes over the U.S. are likely due to human activity.",

        "abstract": "We present an approach to testing climate models with observations. In this approach, it is possible to directly observe the longwave feedbacks of the climate system in timeseries of annual average outgoing longwave spectra. Tropospheric temperature, stratospheric temperature, water vapor, and carbon dioxide have clear and distinctive signatures in the infrared spectrum, and it is possible to detect trends of these signals unambiguously from trends in the outgoing longwave spectrum by optimal detection techniques. We apply this approach to clear-sky data in the Tropics simulated from the output of an ensemble of climate models. Estimates of the water vapor-longwave feedback by this approach agree to within estimated errors with truth, and it is likely that an uncertainty of 50% can be obtained in twenty years of a continuous timeseries. The correlation of tropospheric temperature and water vapor anomalies can provide a constraint on the water vapor-longwave feedback to 5% uncertainty in twenty years, or 7% in ten years. Thus, it should be possible to place a strong constraint on climate models, which currently show a range of 30% in the water vapor-longwave feedback, in just ten years\u2019 time. These results may not hold in the presence of clouds, however, and so it may be necessary to supplement timeseries of outgoing longwave spectra with GPS radio occultation data, which is insensitive to clouds.",

        "abstract": "The attractiveness of a region for touristic activities depends strongly on the local weather and climate. This paper analyses the vulnerability of the beach tourism sector towards climate change by means of an index approach on a country level. A vulnerability framework for the tourism sector is developed and on its basis, indicators are defined for exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity. A transparent index approach, including a robustness analysis with multiple transformation methods and weighting sets, yields an assessment of the overall relative vulnerability of the beach tourism sector in 51 countries. Aggregate results on an annual level indicate that large developing countries might be among the most vulnerable, small islands states are also vulnerable, especially due to their high sensitivity, and developed high latitude countries as well as Mediterranean countries are amongst the least vulnerable. Despite several limitations of the index approach, the present study contributes to integrating the numerous direct as well as indirect effects climate change may have on beach tourism.",

        "abstract": "The temperatures in large parts of Europe have been record high during the meteorological autumn of 2006. Compared to 1961\u20131990, the 2 m temperature was more than three degrees Celsius above normal from the North side of the Alps to southern Norway. This made it by far the warmest autumn on record in the United Kingdom, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Germany and Switzerland, with the records in Central England going back to 1659, in the Netherlands to 1706 and in Denmark to 1768. The deviations were so large that under the obviously false assumption that the climate does not change, the observed temperatures for 2006 would occur with a probability of less than once every 10 000 years in a large part of Europe, given the distribution defined by the temperatures in the autumn 1901\u20132005. \n\nA better description of the temperature distribution is to assume that the mean changes proportional to the global mean temperature, but the shape of the distribution remains the same. This includes to first order the effects of global warming. Even under this assumption the autumn temperatures were very unusual, with estimates of the return time of 200 to 2000 years in this region. The lower bound of the 95% confidence interval is more than 100 to 300 years. \n\nApart from global warming, linear effects of a southerly circulation are found to give the largest contributions, explaining about half of the anomalies. SST anomalies in the North Sea were also important along the coast. ",

This comparison shows that the model is able to realistically capture the observed climatological large-scale patterns of temperature and precipitation indices, although the quality of the simulations depends on the index and region under consideration. In the climate projections for the twenty-first century, all considered temperature-based indices, minimum Tmin, maximum Tmax, and the frequency of tropical nights, show a significant increase worldwide. Similarly, extreme precipitation, as represented by the maximum 5-day precipitation and the 95th percentile of precipitation, is projected to increase significantly in most regions of the world, especially in those that are relatively wet already under present climate conditions. Analogously, dry spells increase particularly in those regions that are characterized by dry conditions in present-day climate.

        "abstract": "Sea-ice thickness is a key parameter for estimates of salt fluxes to the ocean and the contribution to global thermohaline circulation. Observations of sea-ice thickness in the Southern Ocean are sparse and difficult to collect. An exception to this data gap is time-series data from upward-looking sonars (ULS) which sample the drifting sea ice continuously. In this study we use ULS data from ten different locations over periods ranging from 9 to 25 months to compare with model data. Although these data are limited in space and time, they provide a qualitative indication of the ability of global climate models (GCMs) to adequately represent Southern Ocean sea ice. We compare the ULS data to output from four different GCMs (BCCR-BCM2.0, ECHAM5/MPI-OM, UKMO-HadCM3 and NCAR CCSM3) which were used for the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. They simulate the ice thickness reasonably well, but in most cases average model ice thickness is less than thicknesses derived from ULS data. The seasonal cycle produced by the models correlates well with the ULS except for locations near Maud Rise, where in summer the ULS find a low concentration of thick ice floes. This overly thin ice will have implications for both the salt flux to the central Weddell Sea during the growth season and the freshwater flux during the melt season. Using satellite-derived ice-drift data to calculate transports in the Weddell Sea, we find that the underestimation of ice thickness results in underestimated salt fluxes.",

This includes an analysis of sea ice transport and storage, ocean transport and storage, and net surface flux exchange. Simulated budgets for the late 20th century are compared to available observations, followed by an analysis of simulated changes from 1950 to 2050. The consistent theme over this period is an acceleration of the Arctic hydrological cycle, which is expressed as an increase in the flux of water passing through the hydrologic elements. Increased freshwater inputs to the ocean from net precipitation, river runoff, and net ice\nmelt result. While generally attended by a larger export of liquid freshwater to lower latitudes, primarily through Fram Strait, liquid freshwater storage in the Arctic Ocean increases. In contrast, the export and storage of freshwater in the form of sea ice decreases. The qualitative agreement between models for which the only common forcing is rising greenhouse gas concentrations implicates this greenhouse gas loading as the cause of the change. Although the models perform quite well in their simulations of net precipitation over the Arctic Ocean and terrestrial drainage, they differ significantly regarding the magnitude of the trends and their representation of contemporary mean ocean and sea ice\nbudget terms. To reduce uncertainty in future projections of the Arctic freshwater cycle, the climate models as a group require considerable improvement in these aspects of their simulations.",

Under conditions of warming and increasing precipitation which characterizes both observed and projected climate change over much of Northern Hemisphere land area with seasonal snow cover, the sensitivity analysis indicated snow cover duration (SCD) had the highest climate sensitivity with sensitivity varying with climate regime and elevation.  The largest SCD-climate sensitivity was associated with maritime climates with extensive winter snowfall (e.g. western cordillera of North America - NA).  Analysis of significant local changes in snow cover duration over the 1967-1998 period of NOAA data showed that significant decreases were concentrated in a zone where seasonal mean air temperatures were in the range of -5\u00b0 to +2\u00b0C which extended around the coastal margins of the continents. These findings were echoed by the climate models which showed earlier and more widespread decreases in SCD than annual maximum snow water equivalent (SWEmax) with the zone of earliest significant decreases located over the maritime margins of NA and Western Europe. The lowest SCD-climate sensitivity was observed in continental interior climates with relative cold, dry winters and short snow cover seasons where precipitation plays a greater role in snow cover variability. The sensitivity analysis suggested a potentially complex elevation response of SCD and SWEmax to increasing T and P in mountain regions due to non-linear interactions between the duration of the snow season and snow accumulation rates.",

Results from current climate models indicate that\nwater vapor increases of this magnitude cannot be explained by climate noise alone. In a formal detection and attribution analysis using the pooled results from 22 different climate models, the simulated \"fingerprint\" pattern of anthropogenically-caused changes in water vapor is identifiable with high statistical confidence in the SSM/I data. Experiments in which forcing factors are varied individually suggest that this fingerprint \"match\" is primarily due to human-caused increases in greenhouse gases and not to solar forcing or the recovery from the eruption of Mount Pinatubo. Our findings provide preliminary evidence of an emerging anthropogenic signal in the moisture content of Earth's atmosphere.",

Such disagreement is especially surprising in light of the robust response of the same coupled models to the 20th century forcings.\n\nWe present a statistical analysis of the pre-industrial, 20th century and 21st century A1B scenario simulations among the latest Coupled Model Intercomparison Project dataset (CMIP3). We show that the relationship that links Sahel rainfall anomalies to tropical sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies at interannual time scales in observations is reproduced by most models, independently of the change in the basic state as the world warms. \n\nThe same SST/Sahel relationship can be used to predict the simulated 20th century changes in Sahel rainfall from each model's simulation of changes in Indo-Pacific SST and Atlantic SST meridional gradient, although the prediction overestimates the simulated trends. Conversely, such a relationship does not explain the rainfall trend in the 21st century in a majority of models.    These results are consistent with there being, in most models, a substantial direct positive effect of atmospheric greenhouse gases on Sahel rainfall, not mediated through SST.\n\n",

Of the 22 models analysed 18 produce a transmission signal; eight through both pathways (EP+NP), eight through the EP route only, and two show limited transmissions to WA. Overall, four models fail to simulate transmission through either pathway. The amplitude of the model ENSO controls the strength of the transmission. The meridional extent of the model ENSO determines whether NP Rossby waves are involved. Since most models produce an ENSO anomaly pattern that is too narrow and too equatorially confined, the importance of the NP pathway is underestimated. This model deficiency needs to be alleviated.",

Annual Antarctic snowfall accumulation trends in the GCMs agree with observations during 1960-1999, and the sensitivity of snowfall accumulation to near-surface air temperature fluctuations is approximately the same as observed, about 5 %/K , suggesting that if Antarctic temperatures rise as projected, snowfall increases may partially offset ice sheet mass loss by mitigating an additional 1 mm/y of global sea level rise by 2100. However, 20th century annual Antarctic near-surface air temperature trends in the GCMs are about 2.5-to-5 times larger-than-observed, raising questions about the robustness of the 21st century projections. Resolving the relative contributions of dynamic and radiative forcing on Antarctic temperature variability will be an important step toward improving GCM projections. ",

The evaluation is focused on 12 regions of Australia for the daily simulation\nof precipitation, minimum temperature, and maximum temperature. The evaluation is based on probability\ndensity functions and a simple quantitative measure of how well each climate model can capture the\nobserved probability density functions for each variable and each region is introduced. Across all three\nvariables, the coupled climate models perform better than expected. Precipitation is simulated reasonably\nby most and very well by a small number of models, although the problem with excessive drizzle is apparent\nin most models. Averaged over Australia, 3 of the 14 climate models capture more than 80% of the\nobserved probability density functions for precipitation. Minimum temperature is simulated well, with 10 of\nthe 13 climate models capturing more than 80% of the observed probability density functions.

An overall ranking of the climate models, for each of precipitation,\nmaximum, and minimum temperatures, and averaged over these three variables, is presented. Those climate\nmodels that are skillful over Australia are identified, providing guidance on those climate models that\nshould be used in impacts assessments where those impacts are based on precipitation or temperature.\nThese results have no bearing on how well these models work elsewhere, but the methodology is potentially\nuseful in assessing which of the many climate models should be used by impacts groups.",

There is little impact\non mean precipitation but the better models simulate a larger increase in the annual\nrainfall event combined with a large decrease in the number of rain days. We\ntherefore show that omitting weaker models based on a quantitative skill score\nderived using 20th Century observations provides a means to reduce uncertainty in\nclimate model projections.

Our study aids the development of rainfall simulations for a geographical region that is characterized by important dynamic ocean/atmosphere processes and challenging to be represented accurately by climate models. The cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) analysis and seasonal climatology anomalies show that most models are better at simulating rainfall over northern Australia than the Indonesian maritime region, particularly during Austral winter and spring. The representation of seasonal rainfall remains problematic during Austral summer and autumn. We use cumulative absolute differences to rank the models and the MIUB-ECHO-G model is found to reproduce seasonal rainfall over terrestrial and oceans in the Austral-Indonesian region most accurately.

The response of the global-mean troposphere temperature to increasing greenhouse gases is more likely linear, while the amplitude and period of ENSO fluctuates in a multi-decadal time scale. The climate system model outputs suggest that the multi-decadal modulation of ENSO is related to the delayed response of the subsurface temperature in the tropical Pacific compared to the response time of the sea surface temperature (SST), which would lead a modulation of the vertical temperature gradient. Furthermore, an eigen analysis considering only two parameters, the changes in the zonal contrast of the mean background SST and the changes in the vertical contrast between the mean surface and subsurface temperatures in the tropical Pacific, exhibits a good agreement with the CGCM outputs in terms of the multi-decadal modulations of the ENSO\u2019s amplitude and period. In particular, the change in the vertical contrast, i.e., change in difference between the subsurface temperature and SST, turns out to be more influential on the ENSO modulation than changes in the mean SST itself.",

        "abstract": "The response of the atmospheric large-scale circulation to an enhanced greenhouse gas (GHG) forcing varies among coupled global climate model (CGCM) simulations. In this study, sixteen CGCM simulations of the response of the climate system to a 1\\% per year increase in the atmospheric CO2 concentration to quadrupling are analysed with focus on Northern Hemisphere winter. A common signal in fourteen out of sixteen simulations is an increased or unchanged stationary wave amplitude.\n\nA majority of the simulations may be categorised into one of three groups based on the GHG induced changes in the atmospheric stationary waves. The response of the zonal mean barotropic wind is similar within each group. 50% of the simulations belong to the first group which is categorised by a stationary wave with five waves encompassing the whole NH and a strengthening of the zonal mean barotropic wind. The second and third group, consisting of three and two simulations respectively, are characterised by a broadening and a northward shift of the zonal mean barotropic wind respectively. A linear model of barotropic vorticity is employed to study the importance of these mean flow changes to the stationary wave response. The linear calculations indicate that the GHG induced mean wind changes explain 50%, 4% and 37% of the stationary wave changes in each group respectively. Thus, for the majority of simulations the zonal mean wind changes do significantly explain the stationary wave response.\n",

        "title": "Time variation of climate sensitivity in GCMs",
        "abstract": "Effective climate sensitivity is often assumed to be constant, but previous studies of General Circulation Model (GCM) simulations have found it varying as the simulation progresses. This complicates the fitting of simple models to such simulations, as well as having implications for the estimation of climate sensitivity from observations. This study examines the evolution of the feedbacks determining the climate sensitivity in GCMs submitted to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project.  Apparent centennial timescale variations of climate sensitivity during stabilisation to a forcing can be considered an artifact of using conventional forcings, allowing only for instantaneous effects and stratosphere-adjustment. If the forcing is adjusted for processes occurring on timescales which are short compared to the climate stabilisation timescale then there is little centennial timescale evolution of climate sensitivity in any of the GCMs.  We suggest that much of the apparent variation in climate sensitivity identified in previous studies is actually due to the comparatively fast forcing adjustment. Persistent differences are found in the strength of the feedbacks between the coupled atmosphere--ocean (AO) versions and their atmosphere-mixed-layer ocean (AML) counterparts, (the latter are often assumed to give the climate sensitivity of the AOGCM). This indicates that the response of the dynamic ocean influences the atmospheric feedbacks in some GCMs and that the AML model may not provide a good estimate of the equilibrium climate sensitivity for the parallel AO version. The adjustment to the forcing to account for comparatively fast processes varies in magnitude and sign between GCMs, as well as differing between AO and AML versions of the same model. There is evidence from one AOGCM that the forcing adjustment may take a couple of decades, with implications for observationally based estimates of equilibrium climate sensitivity.  We suggest that at least some of the spread in 21st century global temperature predictions between GCMs is due to differing adjustment processes, hence work to understand these differences should be a priority.",

This experiment is used to investigate the main physical processes involved in the variability of the North Atlantic ocean convection and the induced variability of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (MOC). Three ocean convection sites are simulated, in the Labrador, Irminger and Greenland\u2013Iceland\u2013Norwegian (GIN) Seas in agreement with observations. A mechanism linking the variability of the Arctic sea ice cover and convection in the GIN Seas is highlighted. Contrary to previous suggested mechanisms, in CNRM-CM3 the latter is not modulated by the variability of freshwater export through Fram Strait. Instead, the variability of convection is mainly driven by the variability of the sea ice edge position in the Greenland Sea. In this area, the surface freshwater balance is dominated by the freshwater input due to the melting of sea ice. The ice edge position is modulated either by northwestward geostrophic current anomalies or by an intensification of northerly winds. In the model, stronger than average northerly winds force simultaneous intense convective events in the Irminger and GIN Seas. Convection interacts with the thermohaline circulation on timescales of 5\u201310 years, which translates into MOC anomalies propagating southward from the convection sites.",

        "abstract": "Most state-of-the art global coupled models simulate a weakening of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (MOC) in climate change scenarios but the mechanisms leading to this weakening are still being debated. The third version of the CNRM (Centre National de Recherches M\u00e9t\u00e9orologiques) global atmosphere-ocean-sea ice coupled model (CNRM-CM3) was used to conduct climate change experiments for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report (IPCC AR4). The analysis of the A1B scenario experiment shows that global warming leads to a slowdown of North Atlantic deep ocean convection and thermohaline circulation south of Iceland. This slowdown is triggered by a freshening of the Arctic Ocean and an increase in freshwater outflow through Fram Strait. Sea ice melting in the Barents Sea induces a local amplification of the surface warming, which enhances the cyclonic atmospheric circulation around Spitzberg. This anti-clockwise circulation forces an increase in Fram Strait outflow and a simultaneous increase in ocean transport of warm waters toward the Barents Sea, favouring further sea ice melting and surface warming in the Barents Sea. Additionally, the retreat of sea ice allows more deep water formation north of Iceland and the thermohaline circulation strengthens there. The transport of warm and saline waters toward the Barents Sea is further enhanced, which constitutes a second positive feedback.",

A concept for \u201cGlobal Hyper Climate Modes\u201d is formulated: surface heat flux variability associated with regional atmospheric variability patterns is integrated by the large heat capacity of the extra-tropical oceans, leading to a continuous increase of SST variance towards longer timescales. Atmospheric teleconnections spread the extra-tropical signal to the tropical regions. Once SST anomalies have developed in the Tropics, global atmospheric teleconnections spread the signal around the world creating a global hyper climate mode. A simple model suggests that hyper climate modes can vary on timescales longer than 1,000 years. Ocean dynamics may amplify theses modes and influence the regional expression of the variability, but are not at the heart of the mechanism which produces the hyper modes.",

As in previous model generations, considerable differences in the simulated global mean radiation budgets are also found in the IPCC-AR4 models, particularly in the atmosphere and at the surface. We use a comprehensive set of surface observations to constrain these uncertainties, and focus on the downward shortwave and longwave radiation which can directly be validated against the surface observations. The majority of the IPCC-AR4 models still shows a tendency to overestimate the shortwave and underestimate the longwave downward radiation, each by 6 Wm-2 on average, a long standing problem in many GCMs. A subset of models, however, is now capable of simulating at least one of the downward radiative fluxes with no systematic bias. Model biases in all-sky and clear-sky fluxes are often similar, suggesting that deficiencies in clear-sky radiative transfer calculations are major contributors to the excessive surface insolation in many of the models. No indication is found that the simulated excessive surface insolation is due to missing cloud absorption. \n\n\n\n \n",

The projected frequency of the current 20-year return maximum daily precipitation for that period suggests that extreme precipitation risk will increase heavily over the south and central US but decrease over the Canadian Prairies.

        "abstract": "This study assesses the detectability of external influences in changes of precipitation extremes in the 20th century, which is explored through a perfect model analysis with an ensemble of coupled climate model simulations. Three indices of precipitation extremes are defined from the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution: the 20-yr return value (P20), the median (Pm), and the cumulative probability density as a probability-based index (PI). Time variations of area-averages of these three extreme indices are analyzed over different spatial domains from the globe to continental regions. Treating all forcing simulations (ALL; natural plus anthropogenic) of the 20th century as observations and using a preindustrial control run (CTL) to estimate the internal variability, the amplitudes of response patterns to anthropogenic (ANT), natural (NAT), greenhouse-gases (GHG), and sulfate aerosols (SUL) forcings are estimated using a Bayesian decision method.\n\nResults show that there are decisively detectable ANT signals in global, hemispheric, and zonal band areas. When only land is considered, the global and hemispheric detection results are unchanged, but detectable ANT signals in the zonal bands are limited to low latitudes. The ANT signals are also detectable in the Pm and PI but not in P20 at continental scales over Asia, South America, Africa, and Australia. This indicates that indices located near the center of the GEV distribution (Pm and PI) may give better signal-to-noise ratio than indices representing the tail of the distribution (P20). GHG and NAT signals are also detectable, but less robustly for more limited extreme indices and regions. These results are largely insensitive when model data are masked to mimic the availability of the observed data. An imperfect model analysis in which fingerprints are obtained from simulations with a different GCM suggests that ANT is robustly detectable only at global and hemispheric scales, with high uncertainty in the zonal and continental results.",

However,\nour methodology provides quite a straightforward and quantitatively based means to choose climate models for impact\nassessment in any data-rich region. Specifically, we note that to demonstrate skill in simulating the daily derived PDFs is\nfar more challenging than just simulating the mean (as a model can simulate the mean well by averaging large biases of\nopposite sign).

We demonstrate that\nclimate models have useful skill in simulating observed probability density\nfunctions over two regions of Australia, although the well-known bias of\nexcess rainfall at low rates remains common. We conclude by identifying\nthose climate models that produce the best basis for hydrological impacts\nassessment over two regions of Australia.",

        "abstract": "This paper analyses the changes in the atmospheric circulation pattern that can come happen in the climate of the South America (SA), as consequence of the increase in the concentrations of the C02. For this purpose 5 global models from IPCC AR4 (CCCMA, GFDL, HadCM3, MIROC and GISS) are utilized, for the periods of 1961-1990 (present climate - 20C3M) and 2011-2100 (SRESA2). Among, the models analyzed, the HadCM3 simulates the summer and spring circulation close to its observed, despite of locate the Bolivian High (BA) and the Chaco low (CL) shifted for the southwest of its climatological positions.  On the other hand, for future scenarios the BA is shifted to west, and the CL is stronger and extends its over center of Brazil, generating underestimates the precipitation on the Amazonia.  The GFDL model simulates better the precipitations in fall, over the north of the northeast Brazil. The subtropical highs of the north and south hemisphere show an adequate position to the location of the Intertropical Convergence Zone - ITZC (over 5\u00b0S).  For future scenarios, this model does not change its circulation pattern, and in the last climatology (2071-2100), it generates positive anomalies over the north of the Amazonia.  The GISS model simulates a summer and spring circulation far from its observed in the present climate. However, for the 2071-2100 future scenarios simulates a lot rain over the Amazonia.\n\n",

Satellite observations of cloudiness and radiative fluxes at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) are utilized for comparison. The analysis is confined to the marine subtropics in an attempt to isolate low cloudiness from tropical convective systems. \n\nAll analyzed models have a negative bias in the low cloud fraction (model mean bias of  &#8722;15%). On the other hand, the models show an excess of cloud radiative cooling in the region (model mean excess of 13 W m&#8722;2). The latter bias is shown to mainly originate from too much shortwave reflection by the models clouds rather than biases in the clear-sky fluxes. These results confirm earlier studies, thus no major progress in simulating the marine subtropical clouds is noted. As a consequence of the combination of these two biases, this study suggests that all investigated models are likely to overestimate the radiative response to changes in low level subtropical cloudiness.",

It is observed that in response to global warming, an asymmetric pattern develops between tropical precipitation changes in the northern and southern hemispheres, and this asymmetry is locked with the seasonal cycle of tropical convection. In boreal summer (winter), the northern hemispherical average departure from tropical mean increases (decreases), while the departure of the southern hemispherical average decreases (increases). This implies an enhanced seasonal precipitation range between rainy and dry seasons and an increased precipitation difference between northern and southern hemispheres. \n",

        "abstract": "Similarities and differences between El Nino and global warming are examined in hemispherical and zonal tropical precipitation changes of the ECHAM5/MIP_MO simulations. Similarities include hemispherical asymmetry of tropical precipitation changes. This precipitation asymmetry varies with season. In the boreal summer and fall (winter and spring), positive precipitation anomalies are found over the northern (southern) hemisphere and negative precipitation anomalies are found over the southern (northern) hemisphere. This precipitation asymmetry in both the El Nino and global warming cases is associated with the seasonal migration of the Hadley circulation. However, their causes are different. In El Nino, a meridional moisture gradient between convective and subsidence regions is the fundamental basis for inducing the asymmetry. Over the ascending branch of the Hadley circulation, convection is enhanced by less effective static stability. Over margins of the ascending branch, convection is suppressed by the import of dry air from the descending branch. In global warming, low-level moisture is enhanced significantly due to warmer tropospheric temperature. This enhances vertical moisture transport over the ascending branch of the Hadley circulation, so convection is strengthened. Over the descending branch, the mean Hadley circulation tends to transport relatively drier air downward, so convection is reduced.",

When the tropical North Atlantic is cool (warm) and the Atlantic warm pool is small (large), both the vertical wind shear and the moist static stability over the main development region (MDR) for hurricanes increase (decrease) while tropical cyclone activity decreases (increases). From the IPCC multi-model data set, we find that the North Atlantic warms more slowly than other oceans as the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) decreases, whence a physically consistent scenario, confirmed by IPCC projections, suggests that the atmosphere should respond as if to a small (cool) warm pool and the vertical wind shear and the moist static stability over the MDR should increase, causing tropical cyclone activity to decrease.

        "abstract": "In this study, we present climate change projections based on the results from 23 climate model simulations performed for the IPCC 4th Assessment Report. Statistical methods are used to test how well each model simulated observed average (1961-1990) patterns of mean sea-level pressure, temperature and rainfall over the Australian region. The 15 models with the highest pattern correlations and smallest rms errors are identified. The 21st century simulations are driven by the IPCC \u2018SRES\u2019 greenhouse gas and aerosol emission scenarios. Using the 15 best climate models, annual and seasonal average projections of Australian rainfall and temperature change are derived for various decades. Results are highlighted for 2030 and 2070 for comparison with projections published by CSIRO in 2001. The projections are expressed as ranges,\nincorporating uncertainty in both global warming and regional differences between climate simulations over Australia.\n\nInland regions show greater warming, compared to coastal regions. There are large decreases in the number of days below 0\u00b0C and large increases in the number of days above 35\u00b0C or 40\u00b0C. Rainfall changes are more complex than temperature changes. Although increases and decreases in rainfall are projected in the future, decreases dominate the overall pattern, especially in the south in winter and spring.\n\nCSIRO\u2019s earlier projections, based on nine climate models, appear robust when compared with the updated projections. The patterns and magnitudes of warming are similar, although the updated projections have slightly less warming in coastal regions. The pattern of rainfall change is also similar, particularly the strong decrease in winter and spring over southern Australia, but the updated projections give a more widespread tendency for increases in summer in eastern Australia and a clearer tendency for decreases in autumn in Queensland and the eastern Northern Territory.

Both indices show a reasonable global number and spatial distribution of implied tropical cyclones compared to observations.\n\nUsing the same approach, we evaluate tropical cyclone activity in the last 20 year period of the 20th century in an ensemble of nine Coupled Global Climate Model simulations submitted to the IPCC AR4.  We extend this analysis backwards in time, through the 20th century, and find the ensemble derived CYGP suggests no trend in inferred TC numbers while the YGP, after applying a correction to compensate for its oversensitivity to sea surface temperature, suggests a small upward trend. Both indices give a fair geographical distribution of cyclogenesis. Finally, we assess future tropical cyclone trends using 3 emission scenarios. Using the CYGP, which appears the most robust index for application to climate change, a small increase is predicted in the North-Western Pacific in the A1B and A2 scenarios.",

To evaluate this approach, we investigate the relationship between inter-model similarity in patterns of current regional climate and inter-model similarity in patterns of regional enhanced greenhouse response using data from a multi-model database. Correlations of moderate magnitude are common, indicating the value of testing the current regional climate simulation of models. Notably, relationships vary significantly regionally (e.g., are weakest in the tropics), cross variables (e.g., current climate mean sea level pressure is related to temperature and precipitation change in some extra-tropical regions) and can be insensitive to whether the current climate is assessed in the region concerned or globally. The concept demonstrated here can provide a basis for evaluating and weighting models for use in preparing projections of regional climate change.",

Here, we show how both statistical and dynamical downscaling methods applied to relatively coarse-scale atmosphere-ocean general circulation model output are able to improve simulation of spatial and temporal variability in temperature and precipitation across the region. We then develop high-resolution projections of future climate change across the northeast USA, using IPCC SRES emission scenarios combined with these downscaling methods. The projections show increases in temperature that are larger at higher latitudes and inland, as well as the potential for changing precipitation patterns, particularly along the coast. While the absolute magnitude of change expected over the coming century depends on the sensitivity of the climate system to human forcing, significantly higher increases in temperature and in winter precipitation are expected under a higher as compared to lower scenario of future emissions from human activities.",

        "abstract": "Global climate change has already affected the abundances, range limits, and interactions of many species. The hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae), an invasive insect introduced to eastern North America from Japan, has decimated stands of eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) and Carolina hemlock (T. caroliniana) from Georgia to Connecticut. However, its spread across central and northern New England has been slowed substantially by its inability to tolerate cold winter temperatures. Using data from previous lab and field studies collected over the past 17 years, including adelgid spread and overwintering mortality, we first characterize the temperature conditions that may limit adelgid spread. We then show how, in the future, rising winter temperatures due to climate change are likely to remove the conditions currently limiting adelgid spread, and facilitate the northward expansion as more suitable habitat becomes available.",

        "title": "Projected change in climate thresholds in the Northeastern U.S.: implications for crops, pests, livestock, and farmers",
        "abstract": "Most prior climate change assessments for U.S. agriculture have focused on major world food crops such as wheat and maize. While useful from a national and global perspective, these results are not particularly relevant to the Northeastern U.S. agriculture economy, which is dominated by dairy milk production, and high-value horticultural crops such as apples (Malus domestica), grapes (Vitis vinifera), sweet corn (Zea mays var. rugosa), cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata), and maple syrup (sugar maple, Acer saccharum). We used statistically downscaled climate projections generated by the HadCM3 atmosphere\u2013ocean general circulation model, run with Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change future emissions scenarios A1fi (higher) and B1 (lower), to evaluate several climate thresholds of direct relevance to agriculture in the region. A longer (frost-free) growing season could create new opportunities for farmers with enough capital to take risks on new crops (assuming a market for new crops can be developed). However, our results indicate that many crops will have yield losses associated with increased frequency of high temperature stress, inadequate winter chill period for optimum fruiting in spring, increased pressure from marginally over-wintering and/or invasive weeds, insects, or disease, or other factors. Weeds are likely to benefit more than cash crops from increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide. Projections of thermal heat index values for dairy cows indicate a substantial potential negative impact on milk production. At the higher compared to lower emissions scenario, negative climate change effects will occur sooner, and impact a larger geographic area within the region. Farmer adaptations to climate change will not be cost- or risk-free, and the impact on individual farm families and rural communities will depend on commodity produced, available capital, and timely, accurate climate projections.",

        "title": "Sensitivity of future ozone concentrations in the northeast USA to regional climate change",
        "abstract": "An air quality modeling system was used to simulate the effects on ozone concentration in the northeast USA from climate changes projected through the end of the twenty-first century by the National Center for Atmospheric Research\u2019s (NCAR\u2019s) parallel climate model, a fully coupled general circulation model, under a higher and a lower scenario of future global changes in concentrations of radiatively active constituents. The air quality calculations were done with both a global chemistry-transport model and a regional air quality model focused on the northeast USA. The air quality simulations assumed no changes in regional anthropogenic emissions of the chemical species primarily involved in the chemical reactions of ozone creation and destruction, but only accounted for changes in the climate. Together, these idealized global and regional model simulations provide insights into the contribution of possible future climate changes on ozone. Over the coming century, summer climate is projected to be warmer and less cloudy for the northeast USA. These changes are considerably larger under the higher scenario as compared with the lower. Higher temperatures also increase biogenic emissions. Both mean daily and 8-h maximum ozone increase from the combination of three factors that tend to favor higher concentrations: (1) higher temperatures change the rates of reactions and photolysis rates important to the ozone chemistry; (2) lower cloudiness (higher solar radiation) increases the photolysis reaction rates; and (3) higher biogenic emissions increase the concentration of reactive species. Regional model simulations with two cumulus parameterizations produce ozone concentration changes that differ by approximately 10%, indicating that there is considerable uncertainty in the magnitude of changes due to uncertainties in how physical processes should be parameterized in the models. However, the overall effect of the climate changes simulated by these models \u2013 in the absence of reductions in regional anthropogenic emissions \u2013 would be to increase ozone concentrations.",

        "abstract": "With dense population and development along its coastline, the northeastern United States is, at present, highly vulnerable to coastal flooding. At five sea level stations in the United States, from Massachusetts to New Jersey, sea level rise (SLR) trends and tidal effects were removed from the hourly sea level time series and then frequency analysis was performed on the positive remaining anomalies that represent storm surge heights. Then using eustatic SLR estimates for lower and higher greenhouse gas emissions scenarios and assumed trends in local sea level rise, new recurrence intervals were determined for future storm surges. Under the higher emissions scenario, by 2050, the elevation of the 2005 100-year event may be equaled or exceeded at least every 30 years at all sites. In more exposed US cities such as Boston, Massachusetts and Atlantic City, New Jersey, this could occur at the considerably higher frequency of every 8 years or less. Under the lower emissions scenario, by 2050, the elevation of the 2005 100-year event may be equaled or exceeded at least every 70 years at all sites. In Boston and Atlantic City, this could occur every 30 years or less.",

        "abstract": "Winter recreation is an important part of the cultural identity of the Northeast United States and is a multibillion dollar contributor to the regional economy. This study examined the vulnerability of the two largest winter recreation industries, snowmobiling and alpine skiing, to four climate change scenarios for the twenty-first century. Under all scenarios, natural snow became an increasingly scarce resource. The diminished natural snow pack had a very negative impact on the snowmobile industry. As early as 2010\u20132039, 4 to 6 of the 15 snowmobile study areas were projected to lose more than half of the current season. Reliable snowmobile seasons (>50 days) were virtually eliminated in the region under the A1Fi scenarios by 2070\u20132099. The large investment in snowmaking substantially reduced the vulnerability of the ski industry and climate change posed a risk to only 4 of the 14 ski areas in 2010\u20132039, where average ski seasons declined below 100 days and the probability of being open for the entire Christmas\u2013New Year\u2019s holiday declined below 75%. Conversely, by 2070\u20132099 only four ski study areas had not reached these same economic risk criteria. In order to minimize ski season losses, snowmaking requirements are projected to increase substantially, raising important uncertainties about water availability and cost. Climate change represents a notable threat to the winter recreation sector in the Northeast, and the potential economic ramifications for businesses and communities heavily invested in winter tourism and related real estate is sizeable.",

The consequences of future pathways of greenhouse gas emissions on projected climate and impacts across climate-sensitive sectors is assessed by using downscaled projections from three global climate models under both higher (Alfi) and lower (B1) emissions scenarios. The findings illustrate that near-term reductions in emissions can greatly reduce the extent and severity of regionally important impacts on natural and managed ecosystems and public health in the latter half of this century, and increase the feasibility that those impacts which are now unavoidable can be successfully managed through adaptation.",

        "abstract": "An increase in the rate of sea-level rise and potential changes in storminess represent important components of global climate change that will likely affect the extensive coasts of the Northeastern USA. Raising sea level not only increases the likelihood of coastal flooding, but changes the template for waves and tides to sculpt the coast, which can lead to land loss orders of magnitude greater than that from direct inundation alone. There is little question that sea-level rise, and in particular an increased rate of rise, will result in permanent losses of coastal land. However, quantitative predictions of these future coastal change remains difficult due in part to the complexity of coastal systems and the influence of infrequent storm events, and is further confounded by coastal science\u2019s insufficient understanding of the behavior of coastal systems over decadal timescales. Recently, dramatic improvements in technology have greatly improved our capabilities to investigate and characterize processes and sedimentary deposits in the coastal zone, allowing us, for the first time, to address some of the over-arching problems involved in shoreline change. Despite advances in many areas of coastal geology, our fundamental understanding of shoreline change has been limited by a lack of a broad and integrated scientific focus, a lack of resources, and a lack of willingness on the part of policymakers who make crucial decisions about human activity along the coast to support basic research in this area. Although quantitative predictions remain constrained, there remains little doubt that the predicted climates changes will have profound effects upon the Northeastern coast.",

        "abstract": "We evaluated 134 tree species from the eastern United States for potential response to several scenarios of climate change, and summarized those responses for nine northeastern United States. We modeled and mapped each species individually and show current and potential future distributions for two emission scenarios (A1fi [higher emission] and B1 [lower emission]) and three climate models: the Parallel Climate, the Hadley CM3, and the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory model. Climate change could have large impacts on suitable habitat for tree species in this region, especially under a high emissions trajectory. Results indicate that while species with potentially increasing areas of suitable habitat in the Northeastern US substantially outnumber those with decreasing areas of habitat, there are key species that show diminishing habitat area: balsam fir (Abies balsamea), paper birch (Betula papyrifera), red spruce (Picea rubens), bigtooth and quaking aspen (Populus grandidentata and P. tremuloides), and black cherry (Prunus serotina). From these results we identified the top 10 losers and gainers for each US state in the region by scenario and emissions trajectory. By combining individual species importance maps and developing assembly rules for various classes, we created maps of potential forest types for the Northeast showing a general loss of the spruce\u2013fir zone with advancing oak\u2013hickory type.

        "abstract": "We examined the potential impacts of future climate change on the distribution and production of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) on the northeastern USA\u2019s continental shelf. We began by examining the response of cod to bottom water temperature changes observed over the past four decades using fishery-independent resource survey data. After accounting for the overall decline in cod during this period, we show that the probability of catching cod at specified locations decreased markedly with increasing bottom temperature. Our analysis of future changes in water temperature was based on output from three coupled atmosphere\u2013ocean general circulation models under high and low CO2 emissions. An increase of <1.5\u00b0C is predicted for all sectors under the low emission scenario in spring and autumn by the end of this century. Under the high emission scenario, temperature increases range from &#8764;2\u00b0C in the north to >3.5\u00b0C in the Mid-Atlantic Bight. Under these conditions, cod appear vulnerable to a loss of thermal habitat on Georges Bank, with a substantial loss of thermal habitat farther south. We also examined temperature effects on cod recruitment and growth in one stock area, the Gulf of Maine, to explore potential implications for yield and resilience to fishing. Cod survival during the early life stages declined with increasing water temperatures, offsetting potential increases in growth with warmer temperatures and resulting in a predicted loss in yield and increased vulnerability to high fishing mortality rates. Substantial differential impacts under the low versus high emission scenarios are evident for cod off the northeastern USA.",

        "abstract": "Forest ecosystems represent the dominant form of land cover in the northeastern United States and are heavily relied upon by the region\u2019s residents as a source of fuel, fiber, structural materials, clean water, economic vitality, and recreational opportunities. Although predicted changes in climate have important implications for a number of ecosystem processes, our present understanding of their long-term effects is poor. In this study, we used the PnET-CN model of forest carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and water cycling to evaluate the effects of predicted changes in climate and atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) on forest growth, C exchange, water runoff, and nitrate ($$ {\\text{NO}}^{ - }_{3} $$) leaching at five forest research sites across the northeastern U.S. We used four sets of statistically downscaled climate predictions from two general circulation models (the Hadley Centre Coupled Model, version 3 and the Parallel Climate Model) and two scenarios of future CO2 concentrations. A series of model experiments was conducted to examine the effects of future temperature, precipitation, CO2, and various assumptions regarding the physiological response of forests to these changes. Results indicate a wide range of predicted future growth rates. Increased growth was predicted across deciduous sites under most future conditions, while growth declines were predicted for spruce forests under the warmest scenarios and in some deciduous forests when CO2 fertilization effects were absent. Both climate and rising CO2 contributed to predicted changes, but their relative importance shifted from CO2-dominated to climate-dominated from the first to second half of the twenty-first century. Predicted runoff ranged from no change to a slight decrease, depending on future precipitation and assumptions about stomatal response to CO2. Nitrate leaching exhibited variable responses, but was highest under conditions that imposed plant stress with no physiological effects of CO2. Although there are considerable uncertainties surrounding predicted responses to climate change, these results provide a range of possible outcomes and highlight interactions among processes that are likely to be important. Such information can be useful to scientists and land managers as they plan on means of examining and responding to the effects of climate change.",

        "abstract": "We used three approaches to assess potential effects of climate change on birds of the Northeast. First, we created distribution and abundance models for common bird species using climate, elevation, and tree species variables and modeled how bird distributions might change as habitats shift. Second, we assessed potential effects on high-elevation birds, especially Bicknell\u2019s thrush (Catharus bicknelli), that may be particularly vulnerable to climate change, by using statistical associations between climate, spruce-fir forest vegetation and bird survey data. Last, we complemented these projections with an assessment of how habitat quality of a migratory songbird, the black-throated blue warbler (Dendroica caerulescens) might be affected by climate change. Large changes in bird communities of the Northeast are likely to result from climate change, and these changes will be most dramatic under a scenario of continued high emissions. Indeed, high-elevation bird species may currently be at the threshold of critical change with as little as 1\u00b0C warming reducing suitable habitat by more than half. Species at mid elevations are likely to experience declines in habitat quality that could affect demography. Although not all species will be affected adversely, some of the Northeast\u2019s iconic species, such as common loon and black-capped chickadee, and some of its most abundant species, including several neotropical migrants, are projected to decline significantly in abundance under all climate change scenarios. No clear mitigation strategies are apparent, as shifts in species\u2019 abundances and ranges will occur across all habitat types and for species with widely differing ecologies.",
