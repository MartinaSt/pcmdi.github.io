### Participation

Model CCCMA is an entry in both the CMIP1 and CMIP2 intercomparison experiments.

### Spinup/Initialization

The procedure for spinup/initialization of the CCCma coupled model is as follows
(reference: G. Boer and G. Flato, personal communication):

* The model atmosphere was integrated to equilibrium with a mixed-layer ocean
and sea ice. Monthly climatological surface fluxes were obtained.

* The model ocean was spun up for >4000 years from an initial state of rest
with uniform temperature and salinity. The ocean was forced with monthly mean
atmospheric model surface stresses and with relaxation to monthly mean
[Alexander-Mobley (1976)](#references) surface temperatures and
[Levitus (1982)](#references) salinities, where the relaxation time scale was
30 days. Climatological monthly mean surface fluxes were obtained.

* Flux adjustments for heat and fresh water were calculated from the uncoupled
equilibria of the atmospheric and ocean models. An adaptive coupled simulation
with these flux adjustments and relaxation terms with 60-day time scales was
carried out for a period of 14 years, and a refined flux adjustment was
obtained. Finally, the fresh-water flux adjustments were further modified based
on residual model drift during an additional coupled simulation of 5 years.

* The models were coupled and run for an additional 20 years with the refined
flux adjustments imposed prior to the beginning of the experiment, whose
nominal start time was the year 1850. The coupled model then was integrated
for 200 years, exhibiting a residual drift of ~0.1 deg C per century. In order
to be well-separated from the initial state, data retained from nominal years
1900 to 2150 was provided for CMIP.

### Land Surface Processes

* Soil heat storage is determined as a residual of the surface heat fluxes and
of the heat source/sink of freezing/melting snow cover and soil ice (see
below). Soil temperature is computed from this heat storage in a single layer,
following the method of [Deardorff (1978)](#references)which accounts for both
diurnal and longer-period forcing. The composite conductivity/heat capacity of
the soil in each grid box is computed as a function of soil type, soil
moisture, and snow cover.

* Soil moisture is predicted by a single-layer "bucket" model with field
capacity and slope factors varying by primary/secondary soil and vegetation
types for each grid box. Soil moisture budgets include both liquid and frozen
water. The effective local moisture capacity is given by the product of field
capacity and slope factor, with evapotranspiration efficiency beta a function
of the ratio of soil moisture to the local effective moisture capacity. Runoff
occurs implicitly if this ratio exceeds 1 (which is more likely the higher the
local slope factor and the lower the local field capacity). Runoff from GCM
squares within a river basin is transported directly to the ocean grid square
at the mouth of the river. Cf. [McFarlane et al. (1992)](#references),
[Boer et al. (1984)](#references), and [Flato et al. (1998)](#references) for
further details.

### Sea Ice

* Sea ice forms when the temperature of the ocean mixed layer is less than the
freezing point of salt water (approximately 271.18 K). Until the ice mass
exceeds a threshold of 45 kg m-2, however,the ocean surface is not considered
to be ice-covered. Leads are represented as thin-ice regions, with mass equal
to this threshold value. The fractional area of leads decreases as the total
ice mass increases.

* Snow may accumulate on sea ice. Snow that falls on thin ice, or on ice whose
mass is less than 45 kg m-2, is assumed to directly augment the ice. The
average density of snow on the ice is 275 kg m-3; this increases exponentially
with depth (at an e-folding value of 1.85 m). To prevent the density profile
of snow from exceeding that of the ice, the snow mass is limited to 1180
kg m-2, with any excess being converted to ice. Snow also affects the surface
albedo.

* Sea ice thermodynamics follow [Semtner (1976)](#references). The surface
temperature of the ice is a prognostic function of the surface heat balance and
of a conduction heat flux from the underlying ocean. The conduction flux,
which depends on the ice thickness and the temperature gradient between the
ocean and the ice, is specified to restore ice amounts/extents to
climatological values. In order to prevent unbounded growth of ice, negative
heat flux and temperature adjustments are disallowed if the ice thickness
exceeds 2 m. In the Southern ocean, a heat flux of at least 14 W m-2 is
extracted from the ocean to prevent continuous accumulation of ice when
temperatures are too cold to allow summer melt.

* Sea ice dynamics and rheology are neglected. For further information see
[McFarlane et al. (1992)](#references).
