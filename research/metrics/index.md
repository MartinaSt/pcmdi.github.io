# PCMDI Metrics Package: Preliminary Results

### Extra-tropical Variability Modes
Metrics for Modes of Variability Metrics for CMIP5/6 models. The Modes of Variability Metrics is developed at Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison (PCMDI) of Lawrence Livermore Natioanal Laboratory (LLNL). The metrics were developed by Jiwoo Lee, Ken Sperber, Peter Gleckler, Celine Bonfils, and Karl Taylor.

### Monsoon Precipitation: Fractional Accumulation
Monsoon metrics for CMIP5 models. The Metric is developed at Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison (PCMDI) of Lawrence Livermore Natioanal Laboratory (LLNL). The metrics were developed by Ken Sperber.
